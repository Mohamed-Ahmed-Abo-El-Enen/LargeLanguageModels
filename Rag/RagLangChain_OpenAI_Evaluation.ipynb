                                                Create an Endpoint\\n\\nAfter your first login, you will be directed to the [Endpoint creation page](https://ui.endpoints.huggingface.co/new). As an example, this guide will go through the steps to deploy [distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english) for text classification. \\n\\n## 1. Enter the Hugging Face Repository ID and your desired endpoint name:\\n\\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/hf-endpoints-documentation/main/assets/1_repository.png\" alt=\"select repository\" />\\n\\n## 2. Select your Cloud Provider and region. Initially, only AWS will be available as a Cloud Provider with the `us-east-1` and `eu-west-1` regions. We will add Azure soon, and if you need to test Endpoints with other Cloud Providers or regions, please let us know.\\n\\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/hf-endpoints-documentation/main/assets/1_region.png\" alt=\"select region\" />\\n\\n## 3. Define the [Security Level](security) for the Endpoint:\\n\\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/hf-endpoints-documentation/main/assets/1_security.png\" alt=\"define security\" />\\n\\n## 4. Create your Endpoint by clicking **Create Endpoint**. By default, your Endpoint is created with a medium CPU (2 x 4GB vCPUs with Intel Xeon Ice Lake) The cost estimate assumes the Endpoint will be up for an entire month, and does not take autoscaling into account.\\n\\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/hf-endpoints-documentation/main/assets/1_create_cost.png\" alt=\"create endpoint\" />\\n\\n## 5. Wait for the Endpoint to build, initialize and run which can take between 1 to 5 minutes.\\n\\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/hf-endpoints-documentation/main/assets/overview.png\" alt=\"overview\" />\\n\\n## 6. Test your Endpoint in the overview with the Inference widget 🏁 🎉!\\n\\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huggingface/hf-endpoints-documentation/main/assets/1_inference.png\" alt=\"run

Where do you start?**\\n\\nThere is no “one size fits all” approach to choosing an evaluation metric, but some good guidelines to keep in mind are:\\n\\n## Categories of metrics\\n\\nThere are 3 high-level categories of metrics:\\n\\n1. *Generic metrics*, which can be applied to a variety of situations and datasets, such as precision and accuracy.\\n2. *Task-specific metrics*, which are limited to a given task, such as Machine Translation (often evaluated using metrics [BLEU](https://huggingface.co/metrics/bleu) or [ROUGE](https://huggingface.co/metrics/rouge)) or Named Entity Recognition (often evaluated with [seqeval](https://huggingface.co/metrics/seqeval)).\\n3. *Dataset-specific metrics*, which aim to measure model performance on specific benchmarks: for instance, the [GLUE benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/glue) has a dedicated [evaluation metric](https://huggingface.co/metrics/glue).\\n\\nLet's look at each of these three cases:\\n\\n### Generic metrics\\n\\nMany of the metrics used in the Machine Learning community are quite generic and can be applied in a variety of tasks and datasets.\\n\\nThis is the case for metrics like [accuracy](https://huggingface.co/metrics/accuracy) and [precision](https://huggingface.co/metrics/precision), which can be used for evaluating labeled (supervised) datasets, as well as [perplexity](https://huggingface.co/metrics/perplexity), which can be used for evaluating different kinds of (unsupervised) generative tasks.\\n\\nTo see the input structure of a given metric, you can look at its metric card. For example, in the case of [precision](https://huggingface.co/metrics/precision), the format is:\\n```\\n>>> precision_metric = evaluate.load(\"precision\")\\n>>> results = precision_metric.compute(references=[0, 1], predictions=[0, 1])\\n>>> print(results)\\n{'precision': 1.0}\\n```\\n\\n### Task-specific metrics\\n\\nPopular ML tasks like Machine Translation and Named Entity Recognition have specific metrics that can be used to compare models. For example, a series of different metrics have been proposed for text generation, ranging from [BLEU](https://huggingface.co/metrics/bleu) and its derivatives such as [GoogleBLEU](https://huggingface.co/metrics/google_bleu) and [GLEU](https://huggingface.co/metrics/gleu), but also [ROUGE](https://huggingface.co/metrics/rouge), [MAUVE](https://huggingface.co/metrics/mauve), etc.\\n\\nYou can find the right metric for your task by:\\n\\n- **Looking at the [Task pages](https://huggingface.co/tasks)** to see what metrics can be used for evaluating models for a given task.\\n- **Checking out leaderboards** on sites like [Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/) (you can search by task and by dataset).\\n-  **Reading the metric cards** for the relevant metrics and see which ones are a good fit for your use case. For example, see the [BLEU metric card](https://github.com/huggingface/evaluate/tree/main/metrics/bleu) or [SQuaD metric card](https://github.com/huggingface/evaluate/tree/main/metrics/squad).\\n- **Looking at papers and blog posts** published on the topic and see what metrics they report. This can change over time, so try to pick papers from the last couple of years!\\n\\n### Dataset-specific metrics\\n\\nSome datasets have specific metrics associated with them -- this is especially in the case of popular benchmarks like [GLUE](https://huggingface.co/metrics/glue) and [SQuAD](https://huggingface.co/metrics/squad).\\n\\n<Tip warning={true}>\\n💡\\nGLUE is actually a collection of different subsets on different tasks, so first you need to choose the one that corresponds to the NLI task, such as mnli, which is described as “crowdsourced collection of sentence pairs with textual entailment annotations”\\n</Tip>\\n\\n\\nIf you are evaluating your model on a benchmark dataset like the ones mentioned above, you can use its dedicated evaluation metric. Make sure you respect the format that they require. For example, to evaluate your model on the [SQuAD](https://huggingface.co/datasets/squad) dataset, you need to feed the `question` and `context` into your model and return the `prediction_text`, which should be compared with the `references` (based on matching the `id` of the question) :\\n\\n```\\n>>> from evaluate import load\\n>>> squad_metric = load(\"squad\")\\n>>> predictions = [{'prediction_text': '1976', 'id': '56e10a3be3433e1400422b22'}]\\n>>> references = [{'answers': {'answer_start': [97], 'text': ['1976']}, 'id': '56e10a3be3433e1400422b22'}]\\n>>> results = squad_metric.compute(predictions=predictions, references=references)\\n>>> results\\n{'exact_match': 100.0, 'f1': 100.0}\\n```\\n\\nYou can find examples of dataset structures by consulting the \"Dataset Preview\" function or the dataset card for a given dataset, and you can see how to use its dedicated evaluation function based on the metric card.\\n   \n","2

有关更多详细信息，请参阅[主题指南](https://gradio.app/theming-guide)。\\n\\n要增加额外的样式能力，您可以 with `css=` 关键字将任何 CSS 传递给您的应用程序。\\nGradio 应用程序的基类是 `gradio-container`，因此以下是一个更改 Gradio 应用程序背景颜色的示例：\\n\\n```python\\nwith `gr.Interface(css=\".gradio-container {background-color: red}\") as demo:\\n    ...\\n```\\n\\n## 队列 (Queuing)\\n\\n如果您的应用程序预计会有大量流量，请 with `queue()` 方法来控制处理速率。这将排队处理调用，因此一次只处理一定数量的请求。队列使用 Websockets，还可以防止网络超时，因此如果您的函数的推理时间很长（> 1 分钟），应使用队列。\\n\\nwith `Interface`：\\n\\n```python\\ndemo = gr.Interface(...).queue()\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\n\\nwith `Blocks`：\\n\\n```python\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo：\\n    #...\\ndemo.queue()\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\n\\n您可以通过以下方式控制一次处理的请求数量：\\n\\n```python\\ndemo.queue(concurrency_count=3)\\n```\\n\\n查看有关配置其他队列参数的[队列文档](/docs/#queue)。\\n\\n在 Blocks 中指定仅对某些函数进行排队：\\n\\n```python\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo2：\\n    num1 = gr.Number()\\n    num2 = gr.Number()\\n    output = gr.Number()\\n    gr.Button(\"Add\").click(\\n        lambda a, b: a + b, [num1, num2], output)\\n    gr.Button(\"Multiply\").click(\\n        lambda a, b: a * b, [num1, num2], output, queue=True)\\ndemo2.launch()\\n```\\n\\n## 迭代输出 (Iterative Outputs)\\n\\n在某些情况下，您可能需要传输一系列输出而不是一次显示单个输出。例如，您可能有一个图像生成模型，希望显示生成的每个步骤的图像，直到最终图像。或者您可能有一个聊天机器人，它逐字逐句地流式传输响应，而不是一次返回全部响应。\\n\\n在这种情况下，您可以将**生成器**函数提供给 Gradio，而不是常规函数。在 Python 中创建生成器非常简单：函数不应该有一个单独的 `return` 值，而是应该 with `yield` 连续返回一系列值。通常，`yield` 语句放置在某种循环中。下面是一个简单示例，生成器只是简单计数到给定数字：\\n\\n```python\\ndef my_generator(x):\\n    for i in range(x):\\n        yield i\\n```\\n\\n您以与常规函数相同的方式将生成器提供给 Gradio。例如，这是一个（虚拟的）图像生成模型，它在输出图像之前生成数个步骤的噪音：\\n\\n$code_fake_diffusion\\n$demo_fake_diffusion\\n\\n请注意，我们在迭代器中添加了 `time.sleep(1)`，以创建步骤之间的人工暂停，以便您可以观察迭代器的步骤（在真实的图像生成模型中，这可能是不必要的）。\\n\\n将生成器提供给 Gradio **需要**在底层 Interface 或 Blocks 中启用队列（请参阅上面的队列部分）。\\n\\n## 进度条\\n\\nGradio 支持创建自定义进度条，以便您可以自定义和控制向用户显示的进度更新。要启用此功能，只需为方法添加一个默认值为 `gr.Progress` 实例的参数即可。然后，您可以直接调用此实例并传入 0 到 1 之间的浮点数来更新进度级别，或者 with `Progress` 实例的 `tqdm()` 方法来跟踪可迭代对象上的进度，如下所示。必须启用队列以进行进度更新。\\n\\n$code_progress_simple\\n$demo_progress_simple\\n\\n如果您 with `tqdm` 库，并且希望从函数内部的任何 `tqdm.tqdm` 自动报告进度更新，请将默认参数设置为 `gr.Progress(track_tqdm=True)`！\\n\\n## 批处理函数 (Batch Functions)\\n\\nGradio 支持传递*批处理*函数。批处理函数只是接受输入列表并返回预测列表的函数。\\n\\n例如，这是一个批处理函数，它接受两个输入列表（一个单词列表和一个整数列表），并返回修剪过的单词列表作为输出：\\n\\n```python\\nimport time\\n\\ndef trim_words(words, lens):\\n    trimmed_words = []\\n    time.sleep(5)\\n    for w, l in zip(words, lens):\\n        trimmed_words.append(w[:int(l)])\\n    return [trimmed_words]\\n    for w, l in zip(words, lens):\\n```\\n\\n使用批处理函数的优点是，如果启用了队列，Gradio 服务器可以自动*批处理*传入的请求并并行处理它们，从而可能加快演示速度。以下是 Gradio 代码的示例（请注意 `batch=True` 和 `max_batch_size=16` - 这两个参数都可以传递给事件触发器或 `Interface` 类）\\n\\nwith `Interface`：\\n\\n```python\\ndemo = gr.Interface(trim_words, [\"textbox\", \"number\"], [\"output\"],\\n                    batch=True, max_batch_size=16)\\ndemo.queue()\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\n\\nwith `Blocks`：\\n\\n```python\\nimport gradio as gr\\n\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\n    with gr.Row():\\n        word = gr.Textbox(label=\"word\")\\n        leng = gr.Number(label=\"leng\")\\n        output = gr.Textbox(label=\"Output\")\\n    with gr.Row():\\n        run = gr.Button()\\n\\n    event = run.click(trim_words, [word, leng], output, batch=True, max_batch_size=16)\\n\\ndemo.queue()\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\n\\n在上面的示例中，可以并行处理 16 个请求（总推理时间为 5 秒），而不是分别处理每个请求（总推理时间为 80 秒）。许多 Hugging Face 的 `transformers` 和 `diffusers` 模型在 Gradio 的批处理模式下自然工作：这是[使用批处理生成图像的示例演示](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/demo/diffusers_with_batching/run.py)\\n\\n注意：使用 Gradio 的批处理函数 **requires** 在底层 Interface 或 Blocks 中启用队列（请参阅上面的队列部分）。\\n\\n## Gradio 笔记本 (Colab Notebooks)\\n\\nGradio 可以在任何运行 Python 的地方运行，包括本地 Jupyter 笔记本和协作笔记本，如[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)。对于本地 Jupyter 笔记本和 Google Colab 笔记本，Gradio 在本地服务器上运行，您可以在浏览器中与之交互。（注意：对于 Google Colab，这是通过[服务工作器隧道](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/master/docs/design/colab_integration.md)实现的，您的浏览器需要启用 cookies。）对于其他远程笔记本，Gradio 也将在服务器上运行，但您需要使用[SSH 隧道](https://coderwall.com/p/ohk6cg/remote-access-to-ipython-notebooks-via-ssh)在本地浏览器中查看应用程序。通常，更简单的选择是使用 Gradio 内置的公共链接，[在下一篇指南中讨论](/sharing-your-app/#sharing-demos)。\\n   \n","3  !--Copyright 2023 The HuggingFace Team.

They can be used for both network training and inference. They are generally accessed through Google’s cloud services, but small TPUs can also be accessed directly for free through Google Colab and Kaggle Kernels.\\n\\nBecause [all TensorFlow models in 🤗 Transformers are Keras models](https://huggingface.co/blog/tensorflow-philosophy), most of the methods in this document are generally applicable to TPU training for any Keras model! However, there are a few points that are specific to the HuggingFace ecosystem (hug-o-system?) of Transformers and Datasets, and we’ll make sure to flag them up when we get to them.\\n\\n### What kinds of TPU are available?\\n\\nNew users are often very confused by the range of TPUs, and the different ways to access them. The first key distinction to understand is the difference between **TPU Nodes** and **TPU VMs.**\\n\\nWhen you use a **TPU Node**, you are effectively indirectly accessing a remote TPU. You will need a separate VM, which will initialize your network and data pipeline and then forward them to the remote node. When you use a TPU on Google Colab, you are accessing it in the **TPU Node** style.\\n\\nUsing TPU Nodes can have some quite unexpected behaviour for people who aren’t used to them! In particular, because the TPU is located on a physically different system to the machine you’re running your Python code on, your data cannot be local to your machine - any data pipeline that loads from your machine’s internal storage will totally fail! Instead, data must be stored in Google Cloud Storage where your data pipeline can still access it, even when the pipeline is running on the remote TPU node.\\n\\n<Tip>\\n\\nIf you can fit all your data in memory as `np.ndarray` or `tf.Tensor`, then you can `fit()` on that data even when using Colab or a TPU Node, without needing to upload it to Google Cloud Storage.\\n\\n</Tip>\\n\\n<Tip>\\n\\n**🤗Specific Hugging Face Tip🤗:** The methods `Dataset.to_tf_dataset()` and its higher-level wrapper `model.prepare_tf_dataset()` , which you will see throughout our TF code examples, will both fail on a TPU Node. The reason for this is that even though they create a `tf.data.Dataset` it is not a “pure” `tf.data` pipeline and uses `tf.numpy_function` or `Dataset.from_generator()` to stream data from the underlying HuggingFace `Dataset`. This HuggingFace `Dataset` is backed by data that is on a local disc and which the remote TPU Node will not be able to read.\\n\\n</Tip>\\n\\nThe second way to access a TPU is via a **TPU VM.** When using a TPU VM, you connect directly to the machine that the TPU is attached to, much like training on a GPU VM. TPU VMs are generally easier to work with, particularly when it comes to your data pipeline. All of the above warnings do not apply to TPU VMs!\\n\\nThis is an opinionated document, so here’s our opinion: **Avoid using TPU Node if possible.** It is more confusing and more difficult to debug than TPU VMs. It is also likely to be unsupported in future - Google’s latest TPU, TPUv4, can only be accessed as a TPU VM, which suggests that TPU Nodes are increasingly going to become a “legacy” access method. However, we understand that the only free TPU access is on Colab and Kaggle Kernels, which uses TPU Node - so we’ll try to explain how to handle it if you have to! Check the [TPU example notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/tpu_training-tf.ipynb) for code samples that explain this in more detail.\\n\\n### What sizes of TPU are available?\\n\\nA single TPU (a v2-8/v3-8/v4-8) runs 8 replicas. TPUs exist in **pods** that can run hundreds or thousands of replicas simultaneously. When you use more than a single TPU but less than a whole pod (for example, a v3-32), your TPU fleet is referred to as a **pod slice.**\\n\\nWhen you access a free TPU via Colab, you generally get a single v2-8 TPU.\\n\\n### I keep hearing about this XLA thing. What’s XLA, and how does it relate to TPUs?\\n\\nXLA is an optimizing compiler, used by both TensorFlow and JAX. In JAX it is the only compiler, whereas in TensorFlow it is optional (but mandatory on TPU!). The easiest way to enable it when training a Keras model is to pass the argument `jit_compile=True` to `model.compile()`. If you don’t get any errors and performance is good, that’s a great sign that you’re ready to move to TPU!\\n\\nDebugging on TPU is generally a bit harder than on CPU/GPU, so we recommend getting your code running on CPU/GPU with XLA first before trying it on TPU. You don’t have to train for long, of course - just for a few steps to make sure that your model and data pipeline are working like you expect them to.\\n\\n<Tip>\\n\\nXLA compiled code is usually faster - so even if you’re not planning to run on TPU, adding `jit_compile=True` can improve your performance. Be sure to note the caveats below about XLA compatibility, though!\\n\\n</Tip>\\n\\n<Tip warning={true}>\\n\\n**Tip born of painful experience:** Although using `jit_compile=True` is a good way to get a speed boost and test if your CPU/GPU code is XLA-compatible, it can actually cause a lot of problems if you leave it in when actually training on TPU. XLA compilation will happen implicitly on TPU, so remember to remove that line before actually running your code on a TPU!\\n\\n</Tip>\\n\\n### How do I make my model XLA compatible?\\n\\nIn many cases, your code is probably XLA-compatible already! However, there are a few things that work in normal TensorFlow that don’t work in XLA. We’ve distilled them into three core rules below:\\n\\n<Tip>\\n\\n**🤗Specific HuggingFace Tip🤗:** We’ve put a lot of effort into rewriting our TensorFlow models and loss functions to be XLA-compatible. Our models and loss functions generally obey rule #1 and #2 by default, so you can skip over them if you’re using `transformers` models. Don’t forget about these rules when writing your own models and loss functions, though!\\n\\n</Tip>\\n\\n#### XLA Rule #1: Your code cannot have “data-dependent conditionals”\\n\\nWhat that means is that any `if` statement cannot depend on values inside a `tf.Tensor`. For example, this code block cannot be compiled with XLA!\\n\\n```python\\nif tf.reduce_sum(tensor) > 10:\\n    tensor = tensor / 2.0\\n```\\n\\nThis might seem very restrictive at first, but most neural net code doesn’t need to do this. You can often get around this restriction by using `tf.cond` (see the documentation [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/cond)) or by removing the conditional and finding a clever math trick with indicator variables instead, like so:\\n\\n```python\\nsum_over_10 = tf.cast(tf.reduce_sum(tensor) > 10, tf.float32)\\ntensor = tensor / (1.0 + sum_over_10)\\n```\\n\\nThis code has exactly the same effect as the code above, but by avoiding a conditional, we ensure it will compile with XLA without problems!\\n\\n#### XLA Rule #2: Your code cannot have “data-dependent shapes”\\n\\nWhat this means is that the shape of all of the `tf.Tensor` objects in your code cannot depend on their values. For example, the function `tf.unique` cannot be compiled with XLA, because it returns a `tensor` containing one instance of each unique value in the input. The shape of this output will obviously be different depending on how repetitive the input `Tensor` was, and so XLA refuses to handle it!\\n\\nIn general, most neural network code obeys rule #2 by default. However, there are a few common cases where it becomes a problem. One very common one is when you use **label masking**, setting your labels to a negative value to indicate that those positions should be ignored when computing the loss. If you look at NumPy or PyTorch loss functions that support label masking, you will often see code like this that uses [boolean indexing](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.indexing.html#boolean-array-indexing):\\n\\n```python\\nlabel_mask = labels >= 0\\nmasked_outputs = outputs[label_mask]\\nmasked_labels = labels[label_mask]\\nloss = compute_loss(masked_outputs, masked_labels)\\nmean_loss = torch.mean(loss)\\n```\\n\\nThis code is totally fine in NumPy or PyTorch, but it breaks in XLA! Why? Because the shape of `masked_outputs` and `masked_labels` depends on how many positions are masked - that makes it a **data-dependent shape.** However, just like for rule #1, we can often rewrite this code to yield exactly the same output without any data-dependent shapes.\\n\\n```python\\nlabel_mask = tf.cast(labels >= 0, tf.float32)\\nloss = compute_loss(outputs, labels)\\nloss = loss * label_mask  # Set negative label positions to 0\\nmean_loss = tf.reduce_sum(loss) / tf.reduce_sum(label_mask)\\n```\\n\\nHere, we avoid data-dependent shapes by computing the loss for every position, but zeroing out the masked positions in both the numerator and denominator when we calculate the mean, which yields exactly the same result as the first block while maintaining XLA compatibility. Note that we use the same trick as in rule #1 - converting a `tf.bool` to `tf.float32` and using it as an indicator variable. This is a really useful trick, so remember it if you need to convert your own code to XLA!\\n\\n#### XLA Rule #3: XLA will need to recompile your model for every different input shape it sees\\n\\nThis is the big one. What this means is that if your input shapes are very variable, XLA will have to recompile your model over and over, which will create huge performance problems. This commonly arises in NLP models, where input texts have variable lengths after tokenization. In other modalities, static shapes are more common and this rule is much less of a problem.\\n\\nHow can you get around rule #3? The key is **padding** - if you pad all your inputs to the same length, and then use an `attention_mask`, you can get the same results as you’d get from variable shapes, but without any XLA issues. However, excessive padding can cause severe slowdown too - if you pad all your samples to the maximum length in the whole dataset, you might end up with batches consisting endless padding tokens, which will waste a lot of compute and memory!\\n\\nThere isn’t a perfect solution to this problem. However, you can try some tricks. One very useful trick is to **pad batches of samples up to a multiple of a number like 32 or 64 tokens.** This often only increases the number of tokens by a small amount, but it hugely reduces the number of unique input shapes, because every input shape now has to be a multiple of 32 or 64. Fewer unique input shapes means fewer XLA compilations!\\n\\n<Tip>\\n\\n**🤗Specific HuggingFace Tip🤗:** Our tokenizers and data collators have methods that can help you here. You can use `padding=\"max_length\"` or `padding=\"longest\"` when calling tokenizers to get them to output padded data. Our tokenizers and data collators also have a `pad_to_multiple_of` argument that you can use to reduce the number of unique input shapes you see!\\n\\n</Tip>\\n\\n### How do I actually train my model on TPU?\\n\\nOnce your training is XLA-compatible and (if you’re using TPU Node / Colab) your dataset has been prepared appropriately, running on TPU is surprisingly easy! All you really need to change in your code is to add a few lines to initialize your TPU, and to ensure that your model and dataset are created inside a `TPUStrategy` scope. Take a look at [our TPU example notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/tpu_training-tf.ipynb) to see this in action!\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\nThere was a lot in here, so let’s summarize with a quick checklist you can follow when you want to get your model ready for TPU training:\\n\\n- Make sure your code follows the three rules of XLA\\n- Compile your model with `jit_compile=True` on CPU/GPU and confirm that you can train it with XLA\\n- Either load your dataset into memory or use a TPU-compatible dataset loading approach (see [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/tpu_training-tf.ipynb))\\n- Migrate your code either to Colab (with accelerator set to “TPU”) or a TPU VM on Google Cloud\\n- Add TPU initializer code (see [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/tpu_training-tf.ipynb))\\n- Create your `TPUStrategy` and make sure dataset loading and model creation are inside the `strategy.scope()` (see [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/tpu_training-tf.ipynb))\\n- Don’t forget to take `jit_compile=True` out again when you move to TPU!\\n- 🙏🙏🙏🥺🥺🥺\\n- Call model.fit()\\n- You did it!   \n","4

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Git over SSH\\n\\nYou can access and write data in repositories on huggingface.co using SSH (Secure Shell Protocol). When you connect via SSH, you authenticate using a private key file on your local machine.\\n\\nSome actions, such as pushing changes, or cloning private repositories, will require you to upload your SSH public key to your account on huggingface.co.\\n\\nYou can use a pre-existing SSH key, or generate a new one specifically for huggingface.co.\\n\\n## Checking for existing SSH keys\\n\\nIf you have an existing SSH key, you can use that key to authenticate Git operations over SSH.\\n\\nSSH keys are usually located under `~/.ssh` on Mac & Linux, and under `C:\\\\Users\\\\<username>\\\\.ssh` on Windows. List files under that directory and look for files of the form:\\n\\n- id_rsa.pub\\n- id_ecdsa.pub\\n- id_ed25519.pub\\n\\nThose files contain your SSH public key.\\n\\nIf you don't have such file under `~/.ssh`, you will have to [generate a new key](#generating-a-new-ssh-keypair). Otherwise, you can [add your existing SSH public key(s) to your huggingface.co account](#add-a-ssh-key-to-your-account).\\n\\n## Generating a new SSH keypair\\n\\nIf you don't have any SSH keys on your machine, you can use `ssh-keygen` to generate a new SSH key pair (public + private keys):\\n\\n```\\n$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your.email@example.co\"\\n```\\n\\nWe recommend entering a passphrase when you are prompted to. A passphrase is an extra layer of security: it is a password that will be prompted whenever you use your SSH key.\\n\\nOnce your new key is generated, add it to your SSH agent with `ssh-add`:\\n\\n```\\n$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\\n```\\n\\nIf you chose a different location than the default to store your SSH key, you would have to replace `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` with the file location you used.\\n\\n## Add a SSH key to your account\\n\\nTo access private repositories with SSH, or to push changes via SSH, you will need to add your SSH public key to your huggingface.co account. You can manage your SSH keys [in your user settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/keys).\\n\\nTo add a SSH key to your account, click on the \"Add SSH key\" button.\\n\\nThen, enter a name for this key (for example, \"Personal computer\"), and copy and paste the content of your **public** SSH key in the area below. The public key is located in the `~/.ssh/id_XXXX.pub` file you found or generated in the previous steps.\\n\\nClick on \"Add key\", and voilà! You have added a SSH key to your huggingface.co account.\\n\\n\\n## Testing your SSH authentication\\n\\nOnce you have added your SSH key to your huggingface.co account, you can test that the connection works as expected.\\n\\nIn a terminal, run:\\n```\\n$ ssh -T git@hf.co\\n```\\n\\nIf you see a message with your username, congrats! Everything went well, you are ready to use git over SSH.\\n\\nOtherwise, if the message states something like the following, make sure your SSH key is actually used by your SSH agent.\\n```\\nHi

You can easily customize it to your needs.\\n\\n## Fine-tuning on FUNSD\\n\\nFine-tuning LayoutLMv3 for token classification on [FUNSD](https://guillaumejaume.github.io/FUNSD/) can be done as follows:\\n\\n```bash\\npython run_funsd_cord.py \\\\n  --model_name_or_path microsoft/layoutlmv3-base \\\\n  --dataset_name funsd \\\\n  --output_dir layoutlmv3-test \\\\n  --do_train \\\\n  --do_eval \\\\n  --max_steps 1000 \\\\n  --evaluation_strategy steps \\\\n  --eval_steps 100 \\\\n  --learning_rate 1e-5 \\\\n  --load_best_model_at_end \\\\n  --metric_for_best_model \"eval_f1\" \\\\n  --push_to_hub \\\\n  --push_to_hub°model_id layoutlmv3-finetuned-funsd\\n```\\n\\n👀 The resulting model can be found here: https://huggingface.co/nielsr/layoutlmv3-finetuned-funsd. By specifying the `push_to_hub` flag, the model gets uploaded automatically to the hub (regularly), together with a model card, which includes metrics such as precision, recall and F1. Note that you can easily update the model card, as it's just a README file of the respective repo on the hub.\\n\\nThere's also the \"Training metrics\" [tab](https://huggingface.co/nielsr/layoutlmv3-finetuned-funsd/tensorboard), which shows Tensorboard logs over the course of training. Pretty neat, huh?\\n\\n## Fine-tuning on CORD\\n\\nFine-tuning LayoutLMv3 for token classification on [CORD](https://github.com/clovaai/cord) can be done as follows:\\n\\n```bash\\npython run_funsd_cord.py \\\\n  --model_name_or_path microsoft/layoutlmv3-base \\\\n  --dataset_name cord \\\\n  --output_dir layoutlmv3-test \\\\n  --do_train \\\\n  --do_eval \\\\n  --max_steps 1000 \\\\n  --evaluation_strategy steps \\\\n  --eval_steps 100 \\\\n  --learning_rate 5e-5 \\\\n  --load_best_model_at_end \\\\n  --metric_for_best_model \"eval_f1\" \\\\n  --push_to_hub \\\\n  --push_to_hub°model_id layoutlmv3-finetuned-cord\\n```\\n\\n👀 The resulting model can be found here: https://huggingface.co/nielsr/layoutlmv3-finetuned-cord.

Interfaces](https://gradio.app/interface-state), this guide takes a look at state in Blocks, which works mostly the same.\\n\\n## Global State\\n\\nGlobal state in Blocks works the same as in Interface. Any variable created outside a function call is a reference shared between all users.\\n\\n## Session State\\n\\nGradio supports session **state**, where data persists across multiple submits within a page session, in Blocks apps as well. To reiterate, session data is _not_ shared between different users of your model. To store data in a session state, you need to do three things:\\n\\n1. Create a `gr.State()` object. If there is a default value to this stateful object, pass that into the constructor.\\n2. In the event listener, put the `State` object as an input and output.\\n3. In the event listener function, add the variable to the input parameters and the return value.\\n\\nLet's take a look at a game of hangman.\\n\\n$code_hangman\\n$demo_hangman\\n\\nLet's see how we do each of the 3 steps listed above in this game:\\n\\n1. We store the used letters in `used_letters_var`. In the constructor of `State`, we set the initial value of this to `[]`, an empty list.\\n2. In `btn.click()`, we have a reference to `used_letters_var` in both the inputs and outputs.\\n3. In `guess_letter`, we pass the value of this `State` to `used_letters`, and then return an updated value of this `State` in the return statement.\\n\\nWith more complex apps, you will likely have many State variables storing session state in a single Blocks app.\\n\\nLearn more about `State` in the [docs](https://gradio.app/docs#state).\\n   \n","8

spaces:\\nTags: PLOTS, MAPS\\n\\n## 简介\\n\\n本指南介绍如何使用 Gradio 的 `Plot` 组件在地图上绘制地理数据。Gradio 的 `Plot` 组件可以与 Matplotlib、Bokeh 和 Plotly 一起使用。在本指南中，我们将使用 Plotly 进行操作。Plotly 可以让开发人员轻松创建各种地图来展示他们的地理数据。点击[这里](https://plotly.com/python/maps/)查看一些示例。\\n\\n## 概述\\n\\n我们将使用纽约市的 Airbnb 数据集，该数据集托管在 kaggle 上，点击[这里](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)。我已经将其上传到 Hugging Face Hub 作为一个数据集，方便使用和下载，点击[这里](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gradio/NYC-Airbnb-Open-Data)。使用这些数据，我们将在地图上绘制 Airbnb 的位置，并允许基于价格和位置进行筛选。下面是我们将要构建的演示。 ⚡️\\n\\n$demo_map_airbnb\\n\\n## 步骤 1-加载 CSV 数据 💾\\n\\n让我们首先从 Hugging Face Hub 加载纽约市的 Airbnb 数据。\\n\\n```python\\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\\n\\ndataset = load_dataset(\"gradio/NYC-Airbnb-Open-Data\", split=\"train\")\\ndf = dataset.to_pandas()\\n\\ndef filter_map(min_price, max_price, boroughs):\\n    new_df = df[(df['neighbourhood_group'].isin(boroughs)) &\\n            (df['price'] > min_price) & (df['price'] < max_price)]\\n    names = new_df[\"name\"].tolist()\\n    prices = new_df[\"price\"].tolist()\\n    text_list = [(names[i], prices[i]) for i in range(0, len(names))]\\n```\\n\\n在上面的代码中，我们先将 CSV 数据加载到一个 pandas dataframe 中。让我们首先定义一个函数，这将作为 gradio 应用程序的预测函数。该函数将接受最低价格、最高价格范围和筛选结果地区的列表作为参数。我们可以使用传入的值 (`min_price`、`max_price` 和地区列表) 来筛选数据框并创建 `new_df`。接下来，我们将创建包含每个 Airbnb 的名称和价格的 `text_list`，以便在地图上使用作为标签。\\n\\n## 步骤 2-地图图表 🌐\\n\\nPlotly 使得处理地图变得很容易。让我们看一下下面的代码，了解如何创建地图图表。\\n\\n```python\\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\\n\\nfig = go.Figure(go.Scattermapbox(\\n            customdata=text_list,\\n            lat=new_df['latitude'].tolist(),\\n            lon=new_df['longitude'].tolist(),\\n            mode='markers',\\n            marker=go.scattermapbox.Marker(\\n                size=6\\n            ),\\n            hoverinfo=\"text\",\\n            hovertemplate='<b>Name</b>: %{customdata[0]}<br><b>Price</b>: $%{customdata[1]}'\\n        ))\\n\\nfig.update_layout(\\n    mapbox_style=\"open-street-map\",\\n    hovermode='closest',\\n    mapbox=dict(\\n        bearing=0,\\n        center=go.layout.mapbox.Center(\\n            lat=40.67,\\n            lon=-73.90\\n        ),\\n        pitch=0,\\n        zoom=9\\n    ),\\n)\\n```\\n\\n上面的代码中，我们通过传入经纬度列表来创建一个散点图。我们还传入了名称和价格的自定义数据，以便在鼠标悬停在每个标记上时显示额外的信息。接下来，我们使用 `update_layout` 来指定其他地图设置，例如缩放和居中。\\n\\n有关使用 Mapbox 和 Plotly 创建散点图的更多信息，请点击[这里](https://plotly.com/python/scattermapbox/)。\\n\\n## 步骤 3-Gradio 应用程序 ⚡️\\n\\n我们将使用两个 `gr.Number` 组件和一个 `gr.CheckboxGroup` 组件，允许用户指定价格范围和地区位置。然后，我们将使用 `gr.Plot` 组件作为我们之前创建的 Plotly + Mapbox 地图的输出。\\n\\n```python\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\n    with gr.Column():\\n        with gr.Row():\\n            min_price = gr.Number(value=250, label=\"Minimum Price\")\\n            max_price = gr.Number(value=1000, label=\"Maximum Price\")\\n        boroughs = gr.CheckboxGroup(choices=[\"Queens\", \"Brooklyn\", \"Manhattan\", \"Bronx\", \"Staten Island\"], value=[\"Queens\", \"Brooklyn\"], label=\"Select Boroughs:\")\\n        btn = gr.Button(value=\"Update Filter\")\\n        map = gr.Plot()\\n    demo.load(filter_map, [min_price, max_price, boroughs], map)\\n    btn.click(filter_map, [min_price, max_price, boroughs], map)\\n```\\n\\n我们使用 `gr.Column` 和 `gr.Row` 布局这些组件，并为演示加载时和点击 \" 更新筛选 \" 按钮时添加了事件触发器，以触发地图更新新的筛选条件。\\n\\n以下是完整演示代码：\\n\\n$code_map_airbnb\\n\\n## 步骤 4-部署 Deployment 🤗\\n\\n如果你运行上面的代码，你的应用程序将在本地运行。\\n如果要获取临时共享链接，可以将 `share=True` 参数传递给 `launch`。\\n\\n但如果你想要一个永久的部署解决方案呢？\\n让我们将我们的 Gradio 应用程序部署到免费的 HuggingFace Spaces 平台。\\n\\n如果你以前没有使用过 Spaces，请按照之前的指南[这里](/using_hugging_face_integrations)。\\n\\n## 结论

timm.data.transforms_factory import create_transform\\n\\n>>> config = resolve_data_config({}, model=model)\\n>>> transform = create_transform(**config)\\n\\n>>> url, filename = (\"https://github.com/pytorch/hub/raw/master/images/dog.jpg\", \"dog.jpg\")\\n>>> urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, filename)\\n>>> img = Image.open(filename).convert('RGB')\\n>>> tensor = transform(img).unsqueeze(0) # transform and add batch dimension\\n```\\n\\nTo get the model predictions:\\n\\n```py\\n>>> import torch\\n>>> with torch.no_grad():\\n...     out = model(tensor)\\n>>> probabilities = torch.nn.functional.softmax(out[0], dim=0)\\n>>> print(probabilities.shape)\\n>>> # prints: torch.Size([1000])\\n```\\n\\nTo get the top-5 predictions class names:\\n\\n```py\\n>>> # Get imagenet class mappings\\n>>> url, filename = (\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pytorch/hub/master/imagenet_classes.txt\", \"imagenet_classes.txt\")\\n>>> urllib.request.urlretrieve(url,

Where do you start?**\\n\\nThere is no “one size fits all” approach to choosing an evaluation metric, but some good guidelines to keep in mind are:\\n\\n## Categories of metrics\\n\\nThere are 3 high-level categories of metrics:\\n\\n1. *Generic metrics*, which can be applied to a variety of situations and datasets, such as precision and accuracy.\\n2. *Task-specific metrics*, which are limited to a given task, such as Machine Translation (often evaluated using metrics [BLEU](https://huggingface.co/metrics/bleu) or [ROUGE](https://huggingface.co/metrics/rouge)) or Named Entity Recognition (often evaluated with [seqeval](https://huggingface.co/metrics/seqeval)).\\n3. *Dataset-specific metrics*, which aim to measure model performance on specific benchmarks: for instance, the [GLUE benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/glue) has a dedicated [evaluation metric](https://huggingface.co/metrics/glue).\\n\\nLet's look at each of these three cases:\\n\\n### Generic metrics\\n\\nMany of the metrics used in the Machine Learning community are quite generic and can be applied in a variety of tasks and datasets.\\n\\nThis is the case for metrics like [accuracy](https://huggingface.co/metrics/accuracy) and [precision](https://huggingface.co/metrics/precision), which can be used for evaluating labeled (supervised) datasets, as well as [perplexity](https://huggingface.co/metrics/perplexity), which can be used for evaluating different kinds of (unsupervised) generative tasks.\\n\\nTo see the input structure of a given metric, you can look at its metric card. For example, in the case of [precision](https://huggingface.co/metrics/precision), the format is:\\n```\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; precision_metric = evaluate.load(\"precision\")\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; results = precision_metric.compute(references=[0, 1], predictions=[0, 1])\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(results)\\n{'precision': 1.0}\\n```\\n\\n### Task-specific metrics\\n\\nPopular ML tasks like Machine Translation and Named Entity Recognition have specific metrics that can be used to compare models. For example, a series of different metrics have been proposed for text generation, ranging from [BLEU](https://huggingface.co/metrics/bleu) and its derivatives such as [GoogleBLEU](https://huggingface.co/metrics/google_bleu) and [GLEU](https://huggingface.co/metrics/gleu), but also [ROUGE](https://huggingface.co/metrics/rouge), [MAUVE](https://huggingface.co/metrics/mauve), etc.\\n\\nYou can find the right metric for your task by:\\n\\n- **Looking at the [Task pages](https://huggingface.co/tasks)** to see what metrics can be used for evaluating models for a given task.\\n- **Checking out leaderboards** on sites like [Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/) (you can search by task and by dataset).\\n-  **Reading the metric cards** for the relevant metrics and see which ones are a good fit for your use case. For example, see the [BLEU metric card](https://github.com/huggingface/evaluate/tree/main/metrics/bleu) or [SQuaD metric card](https://github.com/huggingface/evaluate/tree/main/metrics/squad).\\n- **Looking at papers and blog posts** published on the topic and see what metrics they report. This can change over time, so try to pick papers from the last couple of years!\\n\\n### Dataset-specific metrics\\n\\nSome datasets have specific metrics associated with them -- this is especially in the case of popular benchmarks like [GLUE](https://huggingface.co/metrics/glue) and [SQuAD](https://huggingface.co/metrics/squad).\\n\\n&lt;Tip warning={true}&gt;\\n💡\\nGLUE is actually a collection of different subsets on different tasks, so first you need to choose the one that corresponds to the NLI task, such as mnli, which is described as “crowdsourced collection of sentence pairs with textual entailment annotations”\\n&lt;/Tip&gt;\\n\\n\\nIf you are evaluating your model on a benchmark dataset like the ones mentioned above, you can use its dedicated evaluation metric. Make sure you respect the format that they require. For example, to evaluate your model on the [SQuAD](https://huggingface.co/datasets/squad) dataset, you need to feed the `question` and `context` into your model and return the `prediction_text`, which should be compared with the `references` (based on matching the `id` of the question) :\\n\\n```\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from evaluate import load\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; squad_metric = load(\"squad\")\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; predictions = [{'prediction_text': '1976', 'id': '56e10a3be3433e1400422b22'}]\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; references = [{'answers': {'answer_start': [97], 'text': ['1976']}, 'id': '56e10a3be3433e1400422b22'}]\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; results = squad_metric.compute(predictions=predictions, references=references)\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; results\\n{'exact_match': 100.0, 'f1': 100.0}\\n```\\n\\nYou can find examples of dataset structures by consulting the \"Dataset Preview\" function or the dataset card for a given dataset, and you can see how to use its dedicated evaluation function based on the metric card.\\n</td>\n","      <td>huggingface/evaluate/blob/main/docs/source/choosing_a_metric.mdx</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>主要特点\\n\\n让我们来介绍一下 Gradio 最受欢迎的一些功能！这里是 Gradio 的主要特点：\\n\\n1. [添加示例输入](#example-inputs)\\n2. [传递自定义错误消息](#errors)\\n3. [添加描述内容](#descriptive-content)\\n4. [设置旗标](#flagging)\\n5. [预处理和后处理](#preprocessing-and-postprocessing)\\n6. [样式化演示](#styling)\\n7.

[在协作笔记本上运行](#colab-notebooks)\\n\\n## 示例输入\\n\\n您可以提供用户可以轻松加载到 \"Interface\" 中的示例数据。这对于演示模型期望的输入类型以及演示数据集和模型一起探索的方式非常有帮助。要加载示例数据，您可以将嵌套列表提供给 Interface 构造函数的 `examples=` 关键字参数。外部列表中的每个子列表表示一个数据样本，子列表中的每个元素表示每个输入组件的输入。有关每个组件的示例数据格式在[Docs](https://gradio.app/docs#components)中有说明。\\n\\n$code_calculator\\n$demo_calculator\\n\\n您可以将大型数据集加载到示例中，通过 Gradio 浏览和与数据集进行交互。示例将自动分页（可以通过 Interface 的 `examples_per_page` 参数进行配置）。\\n\\n继续了解示例，请参阅[更多示例](https://gradio.app/more-on-examples)指南。\\n\\n## 错误\\n\\n您希望向用户传递自定义错误消息。为此，with `gr.Error(\"custom message\")` 来显示错误消息。如果在上面的计算器示例中尝试除以零，将显示自定义错误消息的弹出模态窗口。了解有关错误的更多信息，请参阅[文档](https://gradio.app/docs#error)。\\n\\n## 描述性内容\\n\\n在前面的示例中，您可能已经注意到 Interface 构造函数中的 `title=` 和 `description=` 关键字参数，帮助用户了解您的应用程序。\\n\\nInterface 构造函数中有三个参数用于指定此内容应放置在哪里：\\n\\n- `title`：接受文本，并可以将其显示在界面的顶部，也将成为页面标题。\\n- `description`：接受文本、Markdown 或 HTML，并将其放置在标题正下方。\\n- `article`：也接受文本、Markdown 或 HTML，并将其放置在界面下方。\\n\\n![annotated](/assets/guides/annotated.png)\\n\\n如果您使用的是 `Blocks` API，则可以 with `gr.Markdown(...)` 或 `gr.HTML(...)` 组件在任何位置插入文本、Markdown 或 HTML，其中描述性内容位于 `Component` 构造函数内部。\\n\\n另一个有用的关键字参数是 `label=`，它存在于每个 `Component` 中。这修改了每个 `Component` 顶部的标签文本。还可以为诸如 `Textbox` 或 `Radio` 之类的表单元素添加 `info=` 关键字参数，以提供有关其用法的进一步信息。\\n\\n```python\\ngr.Number(label='年龄', info='以年为单位，必须大于0')\\n```\\n\\n## 旗标\\n\\n默认情况下，\"Interface\" 将有一个 \"Flag\" 按钮。当用户测试您的 `Interface` 时，如果看到有趣的输出，例如错误或意外的模型行为，他们可以将输入标记为您进行查看。在由 `Interface` 构造函数的 `flagging_dir=` 参数提供的目录中，将记录标记的输入到一个 CSV 文件中。如果界面涉及文件数据，例如图像和音频组件，将创建文件夹来存储这些标记的数据。\\n\\n例如，对于上面显示的计算器界面，我们将在下面的旗标目录中存储标记的数据：\\n\\n```directory\\n+-- calculator.py\\n+-- flagged/\\n|   +-- logs.csv\\n```\\n\\n_flagged/logs.csv_\\n\\n```csv\\nnum1,operation,num2,Output\\n5,add,7,12\\n6,subtract,1.5,4.5\\n```\\n\\n与早期显示的冷色界面相对应，我们将在下面的旗标目录中存储标记的数据：\\n\\n```directory\\n+-- sepia.py\\n+-- flagged/\\n|   +-- logs.csv\\n|   +-- im/\\n|   |   +-- 0.png\\n|   |   +-- 1.png\\n|   +-- Output/\\n|   |   +-- 0.png\\n|   |   +-- 1.png\\n```\\n\\n_flagged/logs.csv_\\n\\n```csv\\nim,Output\\nim/0.png,Output/0.png\\nim/1.png,Output/1.png\\n```\\n\\n如果您希望用户提供旗标原因，可以将字符串列表传递给 Interface 的 `flagging_options` 参数。用户在进行旗标时必须选择其中一个字符串，这将作为附加列保存到 CSV 中。\\n\\n## 预处理和后处理 (Preprocessing and Postprocessing)\\n\\n![annotated](/assets/img/dataflow.svg)\\n\\n如您所见，Gradio 包括可以处理各种不同数据类型的组件，例如图像、音频和视频。大多数组件都可以用作输入或输出。\\n\\n当组件用作输入时，Gradio 自动处理*预处理*，将数据从用户浏览器发送的类型（例如网络摄像头快照的 base64 表示）转换为您的函数可以接受的形式（例如 `numpy` 数组）。\\n\\n同样，当组件用作输出时，Gradio 自动处理*后处理*，将数据从函数返回的形式（例如图像路径列表）转换为可以在用户浏览器中显示的形式（例如以 base64 格式显示图像的 `Gallery`）。\\n\\n您可以使用构建图像组件时的参数控制*预处理*。例如，如果您使用以下参数实例化 `Image` 组件，它将将图像转换为 `PIL` 类型，并将其重塑为`(100, 100)`，而不管提交时的原始大小如何：\\n\\n```py\\nimg = gr.Image(shape=(100, 100), type=\"pil\")\\n```\\n\\n相反，这里我们保留图像的原始大小，但在将其转换为 numpy 数组之前反转颜色：\\n\\n```py\\nimg = gr.Image(invert_colors=True, type=\"numpy\")\\n```\\n\\n后处理要容易得多！Gradio 自动识别返回数据的格式（例如 `Image` 是 `numpy` 数组还是 `str` 文件路径？），并将其后处理为可以由浏览器显示的格式。\\n\\n请查看[文档](https://gradio.app/docs)，了解每个组件的所有与预处理相关的参数。\\n\\n## 样式 (Styling)\\n\\nGradio 主题是自定义应用程序外观和感觉的最简单方法。您可以选择多种主题或创建自己的主题。要这样做，请将 `theme=` 参数传递给 `Interface` 构造函数。例如：\\n\\n```python\\ndemo = gr.Interface(..., theme=gr.themes.Monochrome())\\n```\\n\\nGradio 带有一组预先构建的主题，您可以从 `gr.themes.*` 加载。您可以扩展这些主题或从头开始创建自己的主题 - 有关更多详细信息，请参阅[主题指南](https://gradio.app/theming-guide)。\\n\\n要增加额外的样式能力，您可以 with `css=` 关键字将任何 CSS 传递给您的应用程序。\\nGradio 应用程序的基类是 `gradio-container`，因此以下是一个更改 Gradio 应用程序背景颜色的示例：\\n\\n```python\\nwith `gr.Interface(css=\".gradio-container {background-color: red}\") as demo:\\n    ...\\n```\\n\\n## 队列 (Queuing)\\n\\n如果您的应用程序预计会有大量流量，请 with `queue()` 方法来控制处理速率。这将排队处理调用，因此一次只处理一定数量的请求。队列使用 Websockets，还可以防止网络超时，因此如果您的函数的推理时间很长（&gt; 1 分钟），应使用队列。\\n\\nwith `Interface`：\\n\\n```python\\ndemo = gr.Interface(...).queue()\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\n\\nwith `Blocks`：\\n\\n```python\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo：\\n    #...\\ndemo.queue()\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\n\\n您可以通过以下方式控制一次处理的请求数量：\\n\\n```python\\ndemo.queue(concurrency_count=3)\\n```\\n\\n查看有关配置其他队列参数的[队列文档](/docs/#queue)。\\n\\n在 Blocks 中指定仅对某些函数进行排队：\\n\\n```python\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo2：\\n    num1 = gr.Number()\\n    num2 = gr.Number()\\n    output = gr.Number()\\n    gr.Button(\"Add\").click(\\n        lambda a, b: a + b, [num1, num2], output)\\n    gr.Button(\"Multiply\").click(\\n        lambda a, b: a * b, [num1, num2], output, queue=True)\\ndemo2.launch()\\n```\\n\\n## 迭代输出 (Iterative Outputs)\\n\\n在某些情况下，您可能需要传输一系列输出而不是一次显示单个输出。例如，您可能有一个图像生成模型，希望显示生成的每个步骤的图像，直到最终图像。或者您可能有一个聊天机器人，它逐字逐句地流式传输响应，而不是一次返回全部响应。\\n\\n在这种情况下，您可以将**生成器**函数提供给 Gradio，而不是常规函数。在 Python 中创建生成器非常简单：函数不应该有一个单独的 `return` 值，而是应该 with `yield` 连续返回一系列值。通常，`yield` 语句放置在某种循环中。下面是一个简单示例，生成器只是简单计数到给定数字：\\n\\n```python\\ndef my_generator(x):\\n    for i in range(x):\\n        yield i\\n```\\n\\n您以与常规函数相同的方式将生成器提供给 Gradio。例如，这是一个（虚拟的）图像生成模型，它在输出图像之前生成数个步骤的噪音：\\n\\n$code_fake_diffusion\\n$demo_fake_diffusion\\n\\n请注意，我们在迭代器中添加了 `time.sleep(1)`，以创建步骤之间的人工暂停，以便您可以观察迭代器的步骤（在真实的图像生成模型中，这可能是不必要的）。\\n\\n将生成器提供给 Gradio **需要**在底层 Interface 或 Blocks 中启用队列（请参阅上面的队列部分）。\\n\\n## 进度条\\n\\nGradio 支持创建自定义进度条，以便您可以自定义和控制向用户显示的进度更新。要启用此功能，只需为方法添加一个默认值为 `gr.Progress` 实例的参数即可。然后，您可以直接调用此实例并传入 0 到 1 之间的浮点数来更新进度级别，或者 with `Progress` 实例的 `tqdm()` 方法来跟踪可迭代对象上的进度，如下所示。必须启用队列以进行进度更新。\\n\\n$code_progress_simple\\n$demo_progress_simple\\n\\n如果您 with `tqdm` 库，并且希望从函数内部的任何 `tqdm.tqdm` 自动报告进度更新，请将默认参数设置为 `gr.Progress(track_tqdm=True)`！\\n\\n## 批处理函数 (Batch Functions)\\n\\nGradio 支持传递*批处理*函数。批处理函数只是接受输入列表并返回预测列表的函数。\\n\\n例如，这是一个批处理函数，它接受两个输入列表（一个单词列表和一个整数列表），并返回修剪过的单词列表作为输出：\\n\\n```python\\nimport time\\n\\ndef trim_words(words, lens):\\n    trimmed_words = []\\n    time.sleep(5)\\n    for w, l in zip(words, lens):\\n        trimmed_words.append(w[:int(l)])\\n    return [trimmed_words]\\n    for w, l in zip(words, lens):\\n```\\n\\n使用批处理函数的优点是，如果启用了队列，Gradio 服务器可以自动*批处理*传入的请求并并行处理它们，从而可能加快演示速度。以下是 Gradio 代码的示例（请注意 `batch=True` 和 `max_batch_size=16` - 这两个参数都可以传递给事件触发器或 `Interface` 类）\\n\\nwith `Interface`：\\n\\n```python\\ndemo = gr.Interface(trim_words, [\"textbox\", \"number\"], [\"output\"],\\n                    batch=True, max_batch_size=16)\\ndemo.queue()\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\n\\nwith `Blocks`：\\n\\n```python\\nimport gradio as gr\\n\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\n    with gr.Row():\\n        word = gr.Textbox(label=\"word\")\\n        leng = gr.Number(label=\"leng\")\\n        output = gr.Textbox(label=\"Output\")\\n    with gr.Row():\\n        run = gr.Button()\\n\\n    event = run.click(trim_words, [word, leng], output, batch=True, max_batch_size=16)\\n\\ndemo.queue()\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\n\\n在上面的示例中，可以并行处理 16 个请求（总推理时间为 5 秒），而不是分别处理每个请求（总推理时间为 80 秒）。许多 Hugging Face 的 `transformers` 和 `diffusers` 模型在 Gradio 的批处理模式下自然工作：这是[使用批处理生成图像的示例演示](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/demo/diffusers_with_batching/run.py)\\n\\n注意：使用 Gradio 的批处理函数 **requires** 在底层 Interface 或 Blocks 中启用队列（请参阅上面的队列部分）。\\n\\n## Gradio 笔记本 (Colab Notebooks)\\n\\nGradio 可以在任何运行 Python 的地方运行，包括本地 Jupyter 笔记本和协作笔记本，如[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)。对于本地 Jupyter 笔记本和 Google Colab 笔记本，Gradio 在本地服务器上运行，您可以在浏览器中与之交互。（注意：对于 Google Colab，这是通过[服务工作器隧道](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/blob/master/docs/design/colab_integration.md)实现的，您的浏览器需要启用 cookies。）对于其他远程笔记本，Gradio 也将在服务器上运行，但您需要使用[SSH 隧道](https://coderwall.com/p/ohk6cg/remote-access-to-ipython-notebooks-via-ssh)在本地浏览器中查看应用程序。通常，更简单的选择是使用 Gradio 内置的公共链接，[在下一篇指南中讨论](/sharing-your-app/#sharing-demos)。\\n</td>\n","      <td>gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/guides/cn/01_getting-started/02_key-features.md</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>!--Copyright 2023 The HuggingFace Team.

They can be used for both network training and inference. They are generally accessed through Google’s cloud services, but small TPUs can also be accessed directly for free through Google Colab and Kaggle Kernels.\\n\\nBecause [all TensorFlow models in 🤗 Transformers are Keras models](https://huggingface.co/blog/tensorflow-philosophy), most of the methods in this document are generally applicable to TPU training for any Keras model! However, there are a few points that are specific to the HuggingFace ecosystem (hug-o-system?) of Transformers and Datasets, and we’ll make sure to flag them up when we get to them.\\n\\n### What kinds of TPU are available?\\n\\nNew users are often very confused by the range of TPUs, and the different ways to access them. The first key distinction to understand is the difference between **TPU Nodes** and **TPU VMs.**\\n\\nWhen you use a **TPU Node**, you are effectively indirectly accessing a remote TPU. You will need a separate VM, which will initialize your network and data pipeline and then forward them to the remote node. When you use a TPU on Google Colab, you are accessing it in the **TPU Node** style.\\n\\nUsing TPU Nodes can have some quite unexpected behaviour for people who aren’t used to them! In particular, because the TPU is located on a physically different system to the machine you’re running your Python code on, your data cannot be local to your machine - any data pipeline that loads from your machine’s internal storage will totally fail! Instead, data must be stored in Google Cloud Storage where your data pipeline can still access it, even when the pipeline is running on the remote TPU node.\\n\\n&lt;Tip&gt;\\n\\nIf you can fit all your data in memory as `np.ndarray` or `tf.Tensor`, then you can `fit()` on that data even when using Colab or a TPU Node, without needing to upload it to Google Cloud Storage.\\n\\n&lt;/Tip&gt;\\n\\n&lt;Tip&gt;\\n\\n**🤗Specific Hugging Face Tip🤗:** The methods `Dataset.to_tf_dataset()` and its higher-level wrapper `model.prepare_tf_dataset()` , which you will see throughout our TF code examples, will both fail on a TPU Node. The reason for this is that even though they create a `tf.data.Dataset` it is not a “pure” `tf.data` pipeline and uses `tf.numpy_function` or `Dataset.from_generator()` to stream data from the underlying HuggingFace `Dataset`. This HuggingFace `Dataset` is backed by data that is on a local disc and which the remote TPU Node will not be able to read.\\n\\n&lt;/Tip&gt;\\n\\nThe second way to access a TPU is via a **TPU VM.** When using a TPU VM, you connect directly to the machine that the TPU is attached to, much like training on a GPU VM. TPU VMs are generally easier to work with, particularly when it comes to your data pipeline. All of the above warnings do not apply to TPU VMs!\\n\\nThis is an opinionated document, so here’s our opinion: **Avoid using TPU Node if possible.** It is more confusing and more difficult to debug than TPU VMs. It is also likely to be unsupported in future - Google’s latest TPU, TPUv4, can only be accessed as a TPU VM, which suggests that TPU Nodes are increasingly going to become a “legacy” access method. However, we understand that the only free TPU access is on Colab and Kaggle Kernels, which uses TPU Node - so we’ll try to explain how to handle it if you have to! Check the [TPU example notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/tpu_training-tf.ipynb) for code samples that explain this in more detail.\\n\\n### What sizes of TPU are available?\\n\\nA single TPU (a v2-8/v3-8/v4-8) runs 8 replicas. TPUs exist in **pods** that can run hundreds or thousands of replicas simultaneously. When you use more than a single TPU but less than a whole pod (for example, a v3-32), your TPU fleet is referred to as a **pod slice.**\\n\\nWhen you access a free TPU via Colab, you generally get a single v2-8 TPU.\\n\\n### I keep hearing about this XLA thing. What’s XLA, and how does it relate to TPUs?\\n\\nXLA is an optimizing compiler, used by both TensorFlow and JAX. In JAX it is the only compiler, whereas in TensorFlow it is optional (but mandatory on TPU!). The easiest way to enable it when training a Keras model is to pass the argument `jit_compile=True` to `model.compile()`. If you don’t get any errors and performance is good, that’s a great sign that you’re ready to move to TPU!\\n\\nDebugging on TPU is generally a bit harder than on CPU/GPU, so we recommend getting your code running on CPU/GPU with XLA first before trying it on TPU. You don’t have to train for long, of course - just for a few steps to make sure that your model and data pipeline are working like you expect them to.\\n\\n&lt;Tip&gt;\\n\\nXLA compiled code is usually faster - so even if you’re not planning to run on TPU, adding `jit_compile=True` can improve your performance. Be sure to note the caveats below about XLA compatibility, though!\\n\\n&lt;/Tip&gt;\\n\\n&lt;Tip warning={true}&gt;\\n\\n**Tip born of painful experience:** Although using `jit_compile=True` is a good way to get a speed boost and test if your CPU/GPU code is XLA-compatible, it can actually cause a lot of problems if you leave it in when actually training on TPU. XLA compilation will happen implicitly on TPU, so remember to remove that line before actually running your code on a TPU!\\n\\n&lt;/Tip&gt;\\n\\n### How do I make my model XLA compatible?\\n\\nIn many cases, your code is probably XLA-compatible already! However, there are a few things that work in normal TensorFlow that don’t work in XLA. We’ve distilled them into three core rules below:\\n\\n&lt;Tip&gt;\\n\\n**🤗Specific HuggingFace Tip🤗:** We’ve put a lot of effort into rewriting our TensorFlow models and loss functions to be XLA-compatible. Our models and loss functions generally obey rule #1 and #2 by default, so you can skip over them if you’re using `transformers` models. Don’t forget about these rules when writing your own models and loss functions, though!\\n\\n&lt;/Tip&gt;\\n\\n#### XLA Rule #1: Your code cannot have “data-dependent conditionals”\\n\\nWhat that means is that any `if` statement cannot depend on values inside a `tf.Tensor`. For example, this code block cannot be compiled with XLA!\\n\\n```python\\nif tf.reduce_sum(tensor) &gt; 10:\\n    tensor = tensor / 2.0\\n```\\n\\nThis might seem very restrictive at first, but most neural net code doesn’t need to do this. You can often get around this restriction by using `tf.cond` (see the documentation [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/cond)) or by removing the conditional and finding a clever math trick with indicator variables instead, like so:\\n\\n```python\\nsum_over_10 = tf.cast(tf.reduce_sum(tensor) &gt; 10, tf.float32)\\ntensor = tensor / (1.0 + sum_over_10)\\n```\\n\\nThis code has exactly the same effect as the code above, but by avoiding a conditional, we ensure it will compile with XLA without problems!\\n\\n#### XLA Rule #2: Your code cannot have “data-dependent shapes”\\n\\nWhat this means is that the shape of all of the `tf.Tensor` objects in your code cannot depend on their values. For example, the function `tf.unique` cannot be compiled with XLA, because it returns a `tensor` containing one instance of each unique value in the input. The shape of this output will obviously be different depending on how repetitive the input `Tensor` was, and so XLA refuses to handle it!\\n\\nIn general, most neural network code obeys rule #2 by default. However, there are a few common cases where it becomes a problem. One very common one is when you use **label masking**, setting your labels to a negative value to indicate that those positions should be ignored when computing the loss. If you look at NumPy or PyTorch loss functions that support label masking, you will often see code like this that uses [boolean indexing](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.indexing.html#boolean-array-indexing):\\n\\n```python\\nlabel_mask = labels &gt;= 0\\nmasked_outputs = outputs[label_mask]\\nmasked_labels = labels[label_mask]\\nloss = compute_loss(masked_outputs, masked_labels)\\nmean_loss = torch.mean(loss)\\n```\\n\\nThis code is totally fine in NumPy or PyTorch, but it breaks in XLA! Why? Because the shape of `masked_outputs` and `masked_labels` depends on how many positions are masked - that makes it a **data-dependent shape.** However, just like for rule #1, we can often rewrite this code to yield exactly the same output without any data-dependent shapes.\\n\\n```python\\nlabel_mask = tf.cast(labels &gt;= 0, tf.float32)\\nloss = compute_loss(outputs, labels)\\nloss = loss * label_mask  # Set negative label positions to 0\\nmean_loss = tf.reduce_sum(loss) / tf.reduce_sum(label_mask)\\n```\\n\\nHere, we avoid data-dependent shapes by computing the loss for every position, but zeroing out the masked positions in both the numerator and denominator when we calculate the mean, which yields exactly the same result as the first block while maintaining XLA compatibility. Note that we use the same trick as in rule #1 - converting a `tf.bool` to `tf.float32` and using it as an indicator variable. This is a really useful trick, so remember it if you need to convert your own code to XLA!\\n\\n#### XLA Rule #3: XLA will need to recompile your model for every different input shape it sees\\n\\nThis is the big one. What this means is that if your input shapes are very variable, XLA will have to recompile your model over and over, which will create huge performance problems. This commonly arises in NLP models, where input texts have variable lengths after tokenization. In other modalities, static shapes are more common and this rule is much less of a problem.\\n\\nHow can you get around rule #3? The key is **padding** - if you pad all your inputs to the same length, and then use an `attention_mask`, you can get the same results as you’d get from variable shapes, but without any XLA issues. However, excessive padding can cause severe slowdown too - if you pad all your samples to the maximum length in the whole dataset, you might end up with batches consisting endless padding tokens, which will waste a lot of compute and memory!\\n\\nThere isn’t a perfect solution to this problem. However, you can try some tricks. One very useful trick is to **pad batches of samples up to a multiple of a number like 32 or 64 tokens.** This often only increases the number of tokens by a small amount, but it hugely reduces the number of unique input shapes, because every input shape now has to be a multiple of 32 or 64. Fewer unique input shapes means fewer XLA compilations!\\n\\n&lt;Tip&gt;\\n\\n**🤗Specific HuggingFace Tip🤗:** Our tokenizers and data collators have methods that can help you here. You can use `padding=\"max_length\"` or `padding=\"longest\"` when calling tokenizers to get them to output padded data. Our tokenizers and data collators also have a `pad_to_multiple_of` argument that you can use to reduce the number of unique input shapes you see!\\n\\n&lt;/Tip&gt;\\n\\n### How do I actually train my model on TPU?\\n\\nOnce your training is XLA-compatible and (if you’re using TPU Node / Colab) your dataset has been prepared appropriately, running on TPU is surprisingly easy! All you really need to change in your code is to add a few lines to initialize your TPU, and to ensure that your model and dataset are created inside a `TPUStrategy` scope. Take a look at [our TPU example notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/tpu_training-tf.ipynb) to see this in action!\\n\\n### Summary\\n\\nThere was a lot in here, so let’s summarize with a quick checklist you can follow when you want to get your model ready for TPU training:\\n\\n- Make sure your code follows the three rules of XLA\\n- Compile your model with `jit_compile=True` on CPU/GPU and confirm that you can train it with XLA\\n- Either load your dataset into memory or use a TPU-compatible dataset loading approach (see [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/tpu_training-tf.ipynb))\\n- Migrate your code either to Colab (with accelerator set to “TPU”) or a TPU VM on Google Cloud\\n- Add TPU initializer code (see [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/tpu_training-tf.ipynb))\\n- Create your `TPUStrategy` and make sure dataset loading and model creation are inside the `strategy.scope()` (see [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/tpu_training-tf.ipynb))\\n- Don’t forget to take `jit_compile=True` out again when you move to TPU!\\n- 🙏🙏🙏🥺🥺🥺\\n- Call model.fit()\\n- You did it!</td>\n","      <td>huggingface/transformers/blob/main/docs/source/en/perf_train_tpu_tf.md</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>Gradio Demo: blocks_random_slider\\n\\n\\n```\\n!pip install -q gradio \\n```\\n\\n\\n```\\n\\nimport gradio as gr\\n\\n\\ndef func(slider_1, slider_2):\\n    return slider_1 * 5 + slider_2\\n\\n\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\n    slider = gr.Slider(minimum=-10.2, maximum=15, label=\"Random Slider (Static)\", randomize=True)\\n    slider_1 = gr.Slider(minimum=100, maximum=200, label=\"Random Slider (Input 1)\", randomize=True)\\n    slider_2 = gr.Slider(minimum=10, maximum=23.2, label=\"Random Slider (Input 2)\", randomize=True)\\n    slider_3 = gr.Slider(value=3, label=\"Non random slider\")\\n    btn = gr.Button(\"Run\")\\n    btn.click(func, inputs=[slider_1, slider_2], outputs=gr.Number())\\n\\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\\n    demo.launch()\\n\\n```\\n</td>\n","      <td>gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/demo/blocks_random_slider/run.ipynb</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5</th>\n","      <td>Git over SSH\\n\\nYou can access and write data in repositories on huggingface.co using SSH (Secure Shell Protocol).

Otherwise, you can [add your existing SSH public key(s) to your huggingface.co account](#add-a-ssh-key-to-your-account).\\n\\n## Generating a new SSH keypair\\n\\nIf you don't have any SSH keys on your machine, you can use `ssh-keygen` to generate a new SSH key pair (public + private keys):\\n\\n```\\n$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \"your.email@example.co\"\\n```\\n\\nWe recommend entering a passphrase when you are prompted to. A passphrase is an extra layer of security: it is a password that will be prompted whenever you use your SSH key.\\n\\nOnce your new key is generated, add it to your SSH agent with `ssh-add`:\\n\\n```\\n$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\\n```\\n\\nIf you chose a different location than the default to store your SSH key, you would have to replace `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` with the file location you used.\\n\\n## Add a SSH key to your account\\n\\nTo access private repositories with SSH, or to push changes via SSH, you will need to add your SSH public key to your huggingface.co account. You can manage your SSH keys [in your user settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/keys).\\n\\nTo add a SSH key to your account, click on the \"Add SSH key\" button.\\n\\nThen, enter a name for this key (for example, \"Personal computer\"), and copy and paste the content of your **public** SSH key in the area below. The public key is located in the `~/.ssh/id_XXXX.pub` file you found or generated in the previous steps.\\n\\nClick on \"Add key\", and voilà! You have added a SSH key to your huggingface.co account.\\n\\n\\n## Testing your SSH authentication\\n\\nOnce you have added your SSH key to your huggingface.co account, you can test that the connection works as expected.\\n\\nIn a terminal, run:\\n```\\n$ ssh -T git@hf.co\\n```\\n\\nIf you see a message with your username, congrats! Everything went well, you are ready to use git over SSH.\\n\\nOtherwise, if the message states something like the following, make sure your SSH key is actually used by your SSH agent.\\n```\\nHi anonymous, welcome to Hugging Face.\\n```\\n</td>\n","      <td>huggingface/hub-docs/blob/main/docs/hub/security-git-ssh.md</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>6</th>\n","      <td>!---\\nCopyright 2022 The HuggingFace Team.

You can easily customize it to your needs.\\n\\n## Fine-tuning on FUNSD\\n\\nFine-tuning LayoutLMv3 for token classification on [FUNSD](https://guillaumejaume.github.io/FUNSD/) can be done as follows:\\n\\n```bash\\npython run_funsd_cord.py \\\\n  --model_name_or_path microsoft/layoutlmv3-base \\\\n  --dataset_name funsd \\\\n  --output_dir layoutlmv3-test \\\\n  --do_train \\\\n  --do_eval \\\\n  --max_steps 1000 \\\\n  --evaluation_strategy steps \\\\n  --eval_steps 100 \\\\n  --learning_rate 1e-5 \\\\n  --load_best_model_at_end \\\\n  --metric_for_best_model \"eval_f1\" \\\\n  --push_to_hub \\\\n  --push_to_hub°model_id layoutlmv3-finetuned-funsd\\n```\\n\\n👀 The resulting model can be found here: https://huggingface.co/nielsr/layoutlmv3-finetuned-funsd. By specifying the `push_to_hub` flag, the model gets uploaded automatically to the hub (regularly), together with a model card, which includes metrics such as precision, recall and F1. Note that you can easily update the model card, as it's just a README file of the respective repo on the hub.\\n\\nThere's also the \"Training metrics\" [tab](https://huggingface.co/nielsr/layoutlmv3-finetuned-funsd/tensorboard), which shows Tensorboard logs over the course of training. Pretty neat, huh?\\n\\n## Fine-tuning on CORD\\n\\nFine-tuning LayoutLMv3 for token classification on [CORD](https://github.com/clovaai/cord) can be done as follows:\\n\\n```bash\\npython run_funsd_cord.py \\\\n  --model_name_or_path microsoft/layoutlmv3-base \\\\n  --dataset_name cord \\\\n  --output_dir layoutlmv3-test \\\\n  --do_train \\\\n  --do_eval \\\\n  --max_steps 1000 \\\\n  --evaluation_strategy steps \\\\n  --eval_steps 100 \\\\n  --learning_rate 5e-5 \\\\n  --load_best_model_at_end \\\\n  --metric_for_best_model \"eval_f1\" \\\\n  --push_to_hub \\\\n  --push_to_hub°model_id layoutlmv3-finetuned-cord\\n```\\n\\n👀 The resulting model can be found here: https://huggingface.co/nielsr/layoutlmv3-finetuned-cord.

Any variable created outside a function call is a reference shared between all users.\\n\\n## Session State\\n\\nGradio supports session **state**, where data persists across multiple submits within a page session, in Blocks apps as well. To reiterate, session data is _not_ shared between different users of your model. To store data in a session state, you need to do three things:\\n\\n1. Create a `gr.State()` object. If there is a default value to this stateful object, pass that into the constructor.\\n2. In the event listener, put the `State` object as an input and output.\\n3. In the event listener function, add the variable to the input parameters and the return value.\\n\\nLet's take a look at a game of hangman.\\n\\n$code_hangman\\n$demo_hangman\\n\\nLet's see how we do each of the 3 steps listed above in this game:\\n\\n1. We store the used letters in `used_letters_var`. In the constructor of `State`, we set the initial value of this to `[]`, an empty list.\\n2. In `btn.click()`, we have a reference to `used_letters_var` in both the inputs and outputs.\\n3. In `guess_letter`, we pass the value of this `State` to `used_letters`, and then return an updated value of this `State` in the return statement.\\n\\nWith more complex apps, you will likely have many State variables storing session state in a single Blocks app.\\n\\nLearn more about `State` in the [docs](https://gradio.app/docs#state).\\n</td>\n","      <td>gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/guides/03_building-with-blocks/03_state-in-blocks.md</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>8</th>\n","      <td>如何使用地图组件绘制图表\\n\\nRelated spaces:\\nTags: PLOTS, MAPS\\n\\n## 简介\\n\\n本指南介绍如何使用 Gradio 的 `Plot` 组件在地图上绘制地理数据。Gradio 的 `Plot` 组件可以与 Matplotlib、Bokeh 和 Plotly 一起使用。在本指南中，我们将使用 Plotly 进行操作。Plotly 可以让开发人员轻松创建各种地图来展示他们的地理数据。点击[这里](https://plotly.com/python/maps/)查看一些示例。\\n\\n## 概述\\n\\n我们将使用纽约市的 Airbnb 数据集，该数据集托管在 kaggle 上，点击[这里](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)。我已经将其上传到 Hugging Face Hub 作为一个数据集，方便使用和下载，点击[这里](https://huggingface.co/datasets/gradio/NYC-Airbnb-Open-Data)。使用这些数据，我们将在地图上绘制 Airbnb 的位置，并允许基于价格和位置进行筛选。下面是我们将要构建的演示。 ⚡️\\n\\n$demo_map_airbnb\\n\\n## 步骤 1-加载 CSV 数据 💾\\n\\n让我们首先从 Hugging Face Hub 加载纽约市的 Airbnb 数据。\\n\\n```python\\nfrom datasets import load_dataset\\n\\ndataset = load_dataset(\"gradio/NYC-Airbnb-Open-Data\", split=\"train\")\\ndf = dataset.to_pandas()\\n\\ndef filter_map(min_price, max_price, boroughs):\\n    new_df = df[(df['neighbourhood_group'].isin(boroughs)) &amp;\\n            (df['price'] &gt; min_price) &amp; (df['price'] &lt; max_price)]\\n    names = new_df[\"name\"].tolist()\\n    prices = new_df[\"price\"].tolist()\\n    text_list = [(names[i], prices[i]) for i in range(0, len(names))]\\n```\\n\\n在上面的代码中，我们先将 CSV 数据加载到一个 pandas dataframe 中。让我们首先定义一个函数，这将作为 gradio 应用程序的预测函数。该函数将接受最低价格、最高价格范围和筛选结果地区的列表作为参数。我们可以使用传入的值 (`min_price`、`max_price` 和地区列表) 来筛选数据框并创建 `new_df`。接下来，我们将创建包含每个 Airbnb 的名称和价格的 `text_list`，以便在地图上使用作为标签。\\n\\n## 步骤 2-地图图表 🌐\\n\\nPlotly 使得处理地图变得很容易。让我们看一下下面的代码，了解如何创建地图图表。\\n\\n```python\\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\\n\\nfig = go.Figure(go.Scattermapbox(\\n            customdata=text_list,\\n            lat=new_df['latitude'].tolist(),\\n            lon=new_df['longitude'].tolist(),\\n            mode='markers',\\n            marker=go.scattermapbox.Marker(\\n                size=6\\n            ),\\n            hoverinfo=\"text\",\\n            hovertemplate='&lt;b&gt;Name&lt;/b&gt;: %{customdata[0]}&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Price&lt;/b&gt;: $%{customdata[1]}'\\n        ))\\n\\nfig.update_layout(\\n    mapbox_style=\"open-street-map\",\\n    hovermode='closest',\\n    mapbox=dict(\\n        bearing=0,\\n        center=go.layout.mapbox.Center(\\n            lat=40.67,\\n            lon=-73.90\\n        ),\\n        pitch=0,\\n        zoom=9\\n    ),\\n)\\n```\\n\\n上面的代码中，我们通过传入经纬度列表来创建一个散点图。我们还传入了名称和价格的自定义数据，以便在鼠标悬停在每个标记上时显示额外的信息。接下来，我们使用 `update_layout` 来指定其他地图设置，例如缩放和居中。\\n\\n有关使用 Mapbox 和 Plotly 创建散点图的更多信息，请点击[这里](https://plotly.com/python/scattermapbox/)。\\n\\n## 步骤 3-Gradio 应用程序 ⚡️\\n\\n我们将使用两个 `gr.Number` 组件和一个 `gr.CheckboxGroup` 组件，允许用户指定价格范围和地区位置。然后，我们将使用 `gr.Plot` 组件作为我们之前创建的 Plotly + Mapbox 地图的输出。\\n\\n```python\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\n    with gr.Column():\\n        with gr.Row():\\n            min_price = gr.Number(value=250, label=\"Minimum Price\")\\n            max_price = gr.Number(value=1000, label=\"Maximum Price\")\\n        boroughs = gr.CheckboxGroup(choices=[\"Queens\", \"Brooklyn\", \"Manhattan\", \"Bronx\", \"Staten Island\"], value=[\"Queens\", \"Brooklyn\"], label=\"Select Boroughs:\")\\n        btn = gr.Button(value=\"Update Filter\")\\n        map = gr.Plot()\\n    demo.load(filter_map, [min_price, max_price, boroughs], map)\\n    btn.click(filter_map, [min_price, max_price, boroughs], map)\\n```\\n\\n我们使用 `gr.Column` 和 `gr.Row` 布局这些组件，并为演示加载时和点击 \" 更新筛选 \" 按钮时添加了事件触发器，以触发地图更新新的筛选条件。\\n\\n以下是完整演示代码：\\n\\n$code_map_airbnb\\n\\n## 步骤 4-部署 Deployment 🤗\\n\\n如果你运行上面的代码，你的应用程序将在本地运行。\\n如果要获取临时共享链接，可以将 `share=True` 参数传递给 `launch`。\\n\\n但如果你想要一个永久的部署解决方案呢？\\n让我们将我们的 Gradio 应用程序部署到免费的 HuggingFace Spaces 平台。\\n\\n如果你以前没有使用过 Spaces，请按照之前的指南[这里](/using_hugging_face_integrations)。\\n\\n## 结论 🎉\\n\\n你已经完成了！这是构建地图演示所需的所有代码。\\n\\n链接到演示：[地图演示](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio/map_airbnb)和[完整代码](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gradio/map_airbnb/blob/main/run.py)（在 Hugging Face Spaces）\\n</td>\n","      <td>gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/guides/cn/05_tabular-data-science-and-plots/plot-component-for-maps.md</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>9</th>\n","      <td>SE-ResNet\\n\\n**SE ResNet** is a variant of a [ResNet](https://www.paperswithcode.com/method/resnet) that employs [squeeze-and-excitation blocks](https://paperswithcode.com/method/squeeze-and-excitation-block) to enable the network to perform dynamic channel-wise feature recalibration.\\n\\n## How do I use this model on an image?\\n\\nTo load a pretrained model:\\n\\n```py\\n&gt;&gt;&gt;

Hugging Face Spaces\\uff09\\n\",\n          \" Choosing a metric for your task\\n\\n**So you've trained your model and want to see how well it\\u2019s doing on a dataset of your choice. Where do you start?**\\n\\nThere is no \\u201cone size fits all\\u201d approach to choosing an evaluation metric, but some good guidelines to keep in mind are:\\n\\n## Categories of metrics\\n\\nThere are 3 high-level categories of metrics:\\n\\n1. *Generic metrics*, which can be applied to a variety of situations and datasets, such as precision and accuracy.\\n2. *Task-specific metrics*, which are limited to a given task, such as Machine Translation (often evaluated using metrics [BLEU](https://huggingface.co/metrics/bleu) or [ROUGE](https://huggingface.co/metrics/rouge)) or Named Entity Recognition (often evaluated with [seqeval](https://huggingface.co/metrics/seqeval)).\\n3. *Dataset-specific metrics*, which aim to measure model performance on specific benchmarks: for instance, the [GLUE benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/glue) has a dedicated [evaluation metric](https://huggingface.co/metrics/glue).\\n\\nLet's look at each of these three cases:\\n\\n### Generic metrics\\n\\nMany of the metrics used in the Machine Learning community are quite generic and can be applied in a variety of tasks and datasets.\\n\\nThis is the case for metrics like [accuracy](https://huggingface.co/metrics/accuracy) and [precision](https://huggingface.co/metrics/precision), which can be used for evaluating labeled (supervised) datasets, as well as [perplexity](https://huggingface.co/metrics/perplexity), which can be used for evaluating different kinds of (unsupervised) generative tasks.\\n\\nTo see the input structure of a given metric, you can look at its metric card. For example, in the case of [precision](https://huggingface.co/metrics/precision), the format is:\\n```\\n>>> precision_metric = evaluate.load(\\\"precision\\\")\\n>>> results = precision_metric.compute(references=[0, 1], predictions=[0, 1])\\n>>> print(results)\\n{'precision': 1.0}\\n```\\n\\n### Task-specific metrics\\n\\nPopular ML tasks like Machine Translation and Named Entity Recognition have specific metrics that can be used to compare models. For example, a series of different metrics have been proposed for text generation, ranging from [BLEU](https://huggingface.co/metrics/bleu) and its derivatives such as [GoogleBLEU](https://huggingface.co/metrics/google_bleu) and [GLEU](https://huggingface.co/metrics/gleu), but also [ROUGE](https://huggingface.co/metrics/rouge), [MAUVE](https://huggingface.co/metrics/mauve), etc.\\n\\nYou can find the right metric for your task by:\\n\\n- **Looking at the [Task pages](https://huggingface.co/tasks)** to see what metrics can be used for evaluating models for a given task.\\n- **Checking out leaderboards** on sites like [Papers With Code](https://paperswithcode.com/) (you can search by task and by dataset).\\n-  **Reading the metric cards** for the relevant metrics and see which ones are a good fit for your use case. For example, see the [BLEU metric card](https://github.com/huggingface/evaluate/tree/main/metrics/bleu) or [SQuaD metric card](https://github.com/huggingface/evaluate/tree/main/metrics/squad).\\n- **Looking at papers and blog posts** published on the topic and see what metrics they report. This can change over time, so try to pick papers from the last couple of years!\\n\\n### Dataset-specific metrics\\n\\nSome datasets have specific metrics associated with them -- this is especially in the case of popular benchmarks like [GLUE](https://huggingface.co/metrics/glue) and [SQuAD](https://huggingface.co/metrics/squad).\\n\\n<Tip warning={true}>\\n\\ud83d\\udca1\\nGLUE is actually a collection of different subsets on different tasks, so first you need to choose the one that corresponds to the NLI task, such as mnli, which is described as \\u201ccrowdsourced collection of sentence pairs with textual entailment annotations\\u201d\\n</Tip>\\n\\n\\nIf you are evaluating your model on a benchmark dataset like the ones mentioned above, you can use its dedicated evaluation metric. Make sure you respect the format that they require. For example, to evaluate your model on the [SQuAD](https://huggingface.co/datasets/squad) dataset, you need to feed the `question` and `context` into your model and return the `prediction_text`, which should be compared with the `references` (based on matching the `id` of the question) :\\n\\n```\\n>>> from evaluate import load\\n>>> squad_metric = load(\\\"squad\\\")\\n>>> predictions = [{'prediction_text': '1976', 'id': '56e10a3be3433e1400422b22'}]\\n>>> references = [{'answers': {'answer_start': [97], 'text': ['1976']}, 'id': '56e10a3be3433e1400422b22'}]\\n>>> results = squad_metric.compute(predictions=predictions, references=references)\\n>>> results\\n{'exact_match': 100.0, 'f1': 100.0}\\n```\\n\\nYou can find examples of dataset structures by consulting the \\\"Dataset Preview\\\" function or the dataset card for a given dataset, and you can see how to use its dedicated evaluation function based on the metric card.\\n\",\n          \" Git over SSH\\n\\nYou can access and write data in repositories on huggingface.co using SSH (Secure Shell Protocol). When you connect via SSH, you authenticate using a private key file on your local machine.\\n\\nSome actions, such as pushing changes, or cloning private repositories, will require you to upload your SSH public key to your account on huggingface.co.\\n\\nYou can use a pre-existing SSH key, or generate a new one specifically for huggingface.co.\\n\\n## Checking for existing SSH keys\\n\\nIf you have an existing SSH key, you can use that key to authenticate Git operations over SSH.\\n\\nSSH keys are usually located under `~/.ssh` on Mac & Linux, and under `C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\<username>\\\\\\\\.ssh` on Windows. List files under that directory and look for files of the form:\\n\\n- id_rsa.pub\\n- id_ecdsa.pub\\n- id_ed25519.pub\\n\\nThose files contain your SSH public key.\\n\\nIf you don't have such file under `~/.ssh`, you will have to [generate a new key](#generating-a-new-ssh-keypair). Otherwise, you can [add your existing SSH public key(s) to your huggingface.co account](#add-a-ssh-key-to-your-account).\\n\\n## Generating a new SSH keypair\\n\\nIf you don't have any SSH keys on your machine, you can use `ssh-keygen` to generate a new SSH key pair (public + private keys):\\n\\n```\\n$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C \\\"your.email@example.co\\\"\\n```\\n\\nWe recommend entering a passphrase when you are prompted to. A passphrase is an extra layer of security: it is a password that will be prompted whenever you use your SSH key.\\n\\nOnce your new key is generated, add it to your SSH agent with `ssh-add`:\\n\\n```\\n$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519\\n```\\n\\nIf you chose a different location than the default to store your SSH key, you would have to replace `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` with the file location you used.\\n\\n## Add a SSH key to your account\\n\\nTo access private repositories with SSH, or to push changes via SSH, you will need to add your SSH public key to your huggingface.co account. You can manage your SSH keys [in your user settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/keys).\\n\\nTo add a SSH key to your account, click on the \\\"Add SSH key\\\" button.\\n\\nThen, enter a name for this key (for example, \\\"Personal computer\\\"), and copy and paste the content of your **public** SSH key in the area below. The public key is located in the `~/.ssh/id_XXXX.pub` file you found or generated in the previous steps.\\n\\nClick on \\\"Add key\\\", and voil\\u00e0! You have added a SSH key to your huggingface.co account.\\n\\n\\n## Testing your SSH authentication\\n\\nOnce you have added your SSH key to your huggingface.co account, you can test that the connection works as expected.\\n\\nIn a terminal, run:\\n```\\n$ ssh -T git@hf.co\\n```\\n\\nIf you see a message with your username, congrats! Everything went well, you are ready to use git over SSH.\\n\\nOtherwise, if the message states something like the following, make sure your SSH key is actually used by your SSH agent.\\n```\\nHi anonymous, welcome to Hugging Face.\\n```\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n

A routing mechanism (top 1 in this case) associates each token to one of the expert, where each expert is a dense MLP. While switch transformers have a lot more weights than their equivalent dense models, the sparsity allows better scaling and better finetuning performance at scale.\\nDuring a forward pass, only a fraction of the weights are used. The routing mechanism allows the model to select relevant weights on the fly which increases the model capacity without increasing the number of operations.\\n\\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\n*In deep learning, models typically reuse the same parameters for all inputs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) defies this and instead selects different parameters for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model -- with outrageous numbers of parameters -- but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs and training instability -- we address these with the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques help wrangle the instabilities and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the first time, with lower precision (bfloat16) formats. We design models based off T5-Base and T5-Large to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the \"Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus\" and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model.*\\n\\nThis model was contributed by [Younes Belkada](https://huggingface.co/ybelkada) and [Arthur Zucker](https://huggingface.co/ArthurZ).\\nThe original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google/flaxformer/tree/main/flaxformer/architectures/moe).\\n\\n## Usage tips\\n\\n- SwitchTransformers uses the [`T5Tokenizer`], which can be loaded directly from each model's repository.\\n- The released weights are pretrained on English [Masked Language Modeling](https://moon-ci-docs.huggingface.co/docs/transformers/pr_19323/en/glossary#general-terms) task, and should be finetuned.\\n\\n## Resources\\n\\n- [Translation task guide](../tasks/translation)\\n- [Summarization task guide](../tasks/summarization)\\n\\n## SwitchTransformersConfig\\n\\n[[autodoc]] SwitchTransformersConfig\\n\\n## SwitchTransformersTop1Router\\n\\n[[autodoc]] SwitchTransformersTop1Router\\n    - _compute_router_probabilities\\n    - forward\\n\\n## SwitchTransformersSparseMLP\\n\\n[[autodoc]] SwitchTransformersSparseMLP\\n    - forward\\n\\n## SwitchTransformersModel\\n\\n[[autodoc]] SwitchTransformersModel\\n    - forward\\n\\n## SwitchTransformersForConditionalGeneration\\n\\n[[autodoc]] SwitchTransformersForConditionalGeneration\\n    - forward\\n\\n## SwitchTransformersEncoderModel\\n\\n[[autodoc]] SwitchTransformersEncoderModel\\n    - forward\\n   \n","1  !--Copyright 2023 The HuggingFace Team.

Everyone is welcome, and all types of participation –not just code– are valued and appreciated. Answering questions, helping others, reaching out, and improving the documentation are all immensely valuable to the community, so don't be afraid and get involved if you're up for it!\\n\\nEveryone is encouraged to start by saying 👋 in our public Discord channel. We discuss the latest trends in diffusion models, ask questions, show off personal projects, help each other with contributions, or just hang out ☕. <a href=\"https://discord.gg/G7tWnz98XR\"><img alt=\"Join us on Discord\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/discord/823813159592001537?color=5865F2&logo=Discord&logoColor=white\"></a>\\n\\nWhichever way you choose to contribute, we strive to be part of an open, welcoming, and kind community. Please, read our [code of conduct](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and be mindful to respect it during your interactions. We also recommend you become familiar with the [ethical guidelines](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/ethical_guidelines) that guide our project and ask you to adhere to the same principles of transparency and responsibility.\\n\\nWe enormously value feedback from the community, so please do not be afraid to speak up if you believe you have valuable feedback that can help improve the library - every message, comment, issue, and pull request (PR) is read and considered.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nYou can contribute in many ways ranging from answering questions on issues to adding new diffusion models to\\nthe core library.\\n\\nIn the following, we give an overview of different ways to contribute, ranked by difficulty in ascending order. All of them are valuable to the community.\\n\\n* 1. Asking and answering questions on [the Diffusers discussion forum](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/discussion-related-to-httpsgithubcomhuggingfacediffusers) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/G7tWnz98XR).\\n* 2. Opening new issues on [the GitHub Issues tab](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new/choose).\\n* 3. Answering issues on [the GitHub Issues tab](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues).\\n* 4. Fix a simple issue, marked by the \"Good first issue\" label, see [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).\\n* 5. Contribute to the [documentation](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/docs/source).\\n* 6. Contribute a [Community Pipeline](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Acommunity-examples).\\n* 7. Contribute to the [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples).\\n* 8. Fix a more difficult issue, marked by the \"Good second issue\" label, see [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+second+issue%22).\\n* 9. Add a new pipeline, model, or scheduler, see [\"New Pipeline/Model\"](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22New+pipeline%2Fmodel%22) and [\"New scheduler\"](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22New+scheduler%22) issues. For this contribution, please have a look at [Design Philosophy](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/PHILOSOPHY.md).\\n\\nAs said before, **all contributions are valuable to the community**.\\nIn the following, we will explain each contribution a bit more in detail.\\n\\nFor all contributions 4-9, you will need to open a PR. It is explained in detail how to do so in [Opening a pull request](#how-to-open-a-pr).\\n\\n### 1. Asking and answering questions on the Diffusers discussion forum or on the Diffusers Discord\\n\\nAny question or comment related to the Diffusers library can be asked on the [discussion forum](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/discussion-related-to-httpsgithubcomhuggingfacediffusers/) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/G7tWnz98XR). Such questions and comments include (but are not limited to):\\n- Reports of training or inference experiments in an attempt to share knowledge\\n- Presentation of personal projects\\n- Questions to non-official training examples\\n- Project proposals\\n- General feedback\\n- Paper summaries\\n- Asking for help on personal projects that build on top of the Diffusers library\\n- General questions\\n- Ethical questions regarding diffusion models\\n- ...\\n\\nEvery question that is asked on the forum or on Discord actively encourages the community to publicly\\nshare knowledge and might very well help a beginner in the future that has the same question you're\\nhaving. Please do pose any questions you might have.\\nIn the same spirit, you are of immense help to the community by answering such questions because this way you are publicly documenting knowledge for everybody to learn from.\\n\\n**Please** keep in mind that the more effort you put into asking or answering a question, the higher\\nthe quality of the publicly documented knowledge. In the same way, well-posed and well-answered questions create a high-quality knowledge database accessible to everybody, while badly posed questions or answers reduce the overall quality of the public knowledge database.\\nIn short, a high quality question or answer is *precise*, *concise*, *relevant*, *easy-to-understand*, *accessible*, and *well-formated/well-posed*. For more information, please have a look through the [How to write a good issue](#how-to-write-a-good-issue) section.\\n\\n**NOTE about channels**:\\n[*The forum*](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/discussion-related-to-httpsgithubcomhuggingfacediffusers/63) is much better indexed by search engines, such as Google. Posts are ranked by popularity rather than chronologically. Hence, it's easier to look up questions and answers that we posted some time ago.\\nIn addition, questions and answers posted in the forum can easily be linked to.\\nIn contrast, *Discord* has a chat-like format that invites fast back-and-forth communication.\\nWhile it will most likely take less time for you to get an answer to your question on Discord, your\\nquestion won't be visible anymore over time. Also, it's much harder to find information that was posted a while back on Discord. We therefore strongly recommend using the forum for high-quality questions and answers in an attempt to create long-lasting knowledge for the community. If discussions on Discord lead to very interesting answers and conclusions, we recommend posting the results on the forum to make the information more available for future readers.\\n\\n### 2. Opening new issues on the GitHub issues tab\\n\\nThe 🧨 Diffusers library is robust and reliable thanks to the users who notify us of\\nthe problems they encounter. So thank you for reporting an issue.\\n\\nRemember, GitHub issues are reserved for technical questions directly related to the Diffusers library, bug reports, feature requests, or feedback on the library design.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, this means that everything that is **not** related to the **code of the Diffusers library** (including the documentation) should **not** be asked on GitHub, but rather on either the [forum](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/discussion-related-to-httpsgithubcomhuggingfacediffusers/63) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/G7tWnz98XR).\\n\\n**Please consider the following guidelines when opening a new issue**:\\n- Make sure you have searched whether your issue has already been asked before (use the search bar on GitHub under Issues).\\n- Please never report a new issue on another (related) issue. If another issue is highly related, please\\nopen a new issue nevertheless and link to the related issue.\\n- Make sure your issue is written in English. Please use one of the great, free online translation services, such as [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) to translate from your native language to English if you are not comfortable in English.\\n- Check whether your issue might be solved by updating to the newest Diffusers version. Before posting your issue, please make sure that `python -c \"import diffusers; print(diffusers.__version__)\"` is higher or matches the latest Diffusers version.\\n- Remember that the more effort you put into opening a new issue, the higher the quality of your answer will be and the better the overall quality of the Diffusers issues.\\n\\nNew issues usually include the following.\\n\\n#### 2.1. Reproducible, minimal bug reports\\n\\nA bug report should always have a reproducible code snippet and be as minimal and concise as possible.\\nThis means in more detail:\\n- Narrow the bug down as much as you can, **do not just dump your whole code file**.\\n- Format your code.\\n- Do not include any external libraries except for Diffusers depending on them.\\n- **Always** provide all necessary information about your environment; for this, you can run: `diffusers-cli env` in your shell and copy-paste the displayed information to the issue.\\n- Explain the issue. If the reader doesn't know what the issue is and why it is an issue, she cannot solve it.\\n- **Always** make sure the reader can reproduce your issue with as little effort as possible. If your code snippet cannot be run because of missing libraries or undefined variables, the reader cannot help you. Make sure your reproducible code snippet is as minimal as possible and can be copy-pasted into a simple Python shell.\\n- If in order to reproduce your issue a model and/or dataset is required, make sure the reader has access to that model or dataset. You can always upload your model or dataset to the [Hub](https://huggingface.co) to make it easily downloadable. Try to keep your model and dataset as small as possible, to make the reproduction of your issue as effortless as possible.\\n\\nFor more information, please have a look through the [How to write a good issue](#how-to-write-a-good-issue) section.\\n\\nYou can open a bug report [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug-report.yml).\\n\\n#### 2.2. Feature requests\\n\\nA world-class feature request addresses the following points:\\n\\n1. Motivation first:\\n* Is it related to a problem/frustration with the library? If so, please explain\\nwhy. Providing a code snippet that demonstrates the problem is best.\\n* Is it related to something you would need for a project? We'd love to hear\\nabout it!\\n* Is it something you worked on and think could benefit the community?\\nAwesome! Tell us what problem it solved for you.\\n2. Write a *full paragraph* describing the feature;\\n3. Provide a **code snippet** that demonstrates its future use;\\n4. In case this is related to a paper, please attach a link;\\n5. Attach any additional information (drawings, screenshots, etc.) you think may help.\\n\\nYou can open a feature request [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=).\\n\\n#### 2.3 Feedback\\n\\nFeedback about the library design and why it is good or not good helps the core maintainers immensely to build a user-friendly library. To understand the philosophy behind the current design philosophy, please have a look [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/philosophy). If you feel like a certain design choice does not fit with the current design philosophy, please explain why and how it should be changed. If a certain design choice follows the design philosophy too much, hence restricting use cases, explain why and how it should be changed.\\nIf a certain design choice is very useful for you, please also leave a note as this is great feedback for future design decisions.\\n\\nYou can open an issue about feedback [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feedback.md&title=).\\n\\n#### 2.4 Technical questions\\n\\nTechnical questions are mainly about why certain code of the library was written in a certain way, or what a certain part of the code does. Please make sure to link to the code in question and please provide detail on\\nwhy this part of the code is difficult to understand.\\n\\nYou can open an issue about a technical question [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug-report.yml).\\n\\n#### 2.5 Proposal to add a new model, scheduler, or pipeline\\n\\nIf the diffusion model community released a new model, pipeline, or scheduler that you would like to see in the Diffusers library, please provide the following information:\\n\\n* Short description of the diffusion pipeline, model, or scheduler and link to the paper or public release.\\n* Link to any of its open-source implementation.\\n* Link to the model weights if they are available.\\n\\nIf you are willing to contribute to the model yourself, let us know so we can best guide you. Also, don't forget\\nto tag the original author of the component (model, scheduler, pipeline, etc.) by GitHub handle if you can find it.\\n\\nYou can open a request for a model/pipeline/scheduler [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=New+model%2Fpipeline%2Fscheduler&template=new-model-addition.yml).\\n\\n### 3. Answering issues on the GitHub issues tab\\n\\nAnswering issues on GitHub might require some technical knowledge of Diffusers, but we encourage everybody to give it a try even if you are not 100% certain that your answer is correct.\\nSome tips to give a high-quality answer to an issue:\\n- Be as concise and minimal as possible.\\n- Stay on topic. An answer to the issue should concern the issue and only the issue.\\n- Provide links to code, papers, or other sources that prove or encourage your point.\\n- Answer in code. If a simple code snippet is the answer to the issue or shows how the issue can be solved, please provide a fully reproducible code snippet.\\n\\nAlso, many issues tend to be simply off-topic, duplicates of other issues, or irrelevant. It is of great\\nhelp to the maintainers if you can answer such issues, encouraging the author of the issue to be\\nmore precise, provide the link to a duplicated issue or redirect them to [the forum](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/discussion-related-to-httpsgithubcomhuggingfacediffusers/63) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/G7tWnz98XR).\\n\\nIf you have verified that the issued bug report is correct and requires a correction in the source code,\\nplease have a look at the next sections.\\n\\nFor all of the following contributions, you will need to open a PR. It is explained in detail how to do so in the [Opening a pull request](#how-to-open-a-pr) section.\\n\\n### 4. Fixing a \"Good first issue\"\\n\\n*Good first issues* are marked by the [Good first issue](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label. Usually, the issue already\\nexplains how a potential solution should look so that it is easier to fix.\\nIf the issue hasn't been closed and you would like to try to fix this issue, you can just leave a message \"I would like to try this issue.\". There are usually three scenarios:\\n- a.) The issue description already proposes a fix. In this case and if the solution makes sense to you, you can open a PR or draft PR to fix it.\\n- b.) The issue description does not propose a fix. In this case, you can ask what a proposed fix could look like and someone from the Diffusers team should answer shortly. If you have a good idea of how to fix it, feel free to directly open a PR.\\n- c.) There is already an open PR to fix the issue, but the issue hasn't been closed yet. If the PR has gone stale, you can simply open a new PR and link to the stale PR. PRs often go stale if the original contributor who wanted to fix the issue suddenly cannot find the time anymore to proceed. This often happens in open-source and is very normal. In this case, the community will be very happy if you give it a new try and leverage the knowledge of the existing PR. If there is already a PR and it is active, you can help the author by giving suggestions, reviewing the PR or even asking whether you can contribute to the PR.\\n\\n\\n### 5. Contribute to the documentation\\n\\nA good library **always** has good documentation! The official documentation is often one of the first points of contact for new users of the library, and therefore contributing to the documentation is a **highly\\nvaluable contribution**.\\n\\nContributing to the library can have many forms:\\n\\n- Correcting spelling or grammatical errors.\\n- Correct incorrect formatting of the docstring. If you see that the official documentation is weirdly displayed or a link is broken, we are very happy if you take some time to correct it.\\n- Correct the shape or dimensions of a docstring input or output tensor.\\n- Clarify documentation that is hard to understand or incorrect.\\n- Update outdated code examples.\\n- Translating the documentation to another language.\\n\\nAnything displayed on [the official Diffusers doc page](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index) is part of the official documentation and can be corrected, adjusted in the respective [documentation source](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/docs/source).\\n\\nPlease have a look at [this page](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/docs) on how to verify changes made to the documentation locally.\\n\\n\\n### 6. Contribute a community pipeline\\n\\n[Pipelines](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/overview) are usually the first point of contact between the Diffusers library and the user.\\nPipelines are examples of how to use Diffusers [models](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/models/overview) and [schedulers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/schedulers/overview).\\nWe support two types of pipelines:\\n\\n- Official Pipelines\\n- Community Pipelines\\n\\nBoth official and community pipelines follow the same design and consist of the same type of components.\\n\\nOfficial pipelines are tested and maintained by the core maintainers of Diffusers. Their code\\nresides in [src/diffusers/pipelines](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/src/diffusers/pipelines).\\nIn contrast, community pipelines are contributed and maintained purely by the **community** and are **not** tested.\\nThey reside in [examples/community](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/community) and while they can be accessed via the [PyPI diffusers package](https://pypi.org/project/diffusers/), their code is not part of the PyPI distribution.\\n\\nThe reason for the distinction is that the core maintainers of the Diffusers library cannot maintain and test all\\npossible ways diffusion models can be used for inference, but some of them may be of interest to the community.\\nOfficially released diffusion pipelines,\\nsuch as Stable Diffusion are added to the core src/diffusers/pipelines package which ensures\\nhigh quality of maintenance, no backward-breaking code changes, and testing.\\nMore bleeding edge pipelines should be added as community pipelines. If usage for a community pipeline is high, the pipeline can be moved to the official pipelines upon request from the community. This is one of the ways we strive to be a community-driven library.\\n\\nTo add a community pipeline, one should add a <name-of-the-community>.py file to [examples/community](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/community) and adapt the [examples/community/README.md](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/community/README.md) to include an example of the new pipeline.\\n\\nAn example can be seen [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/2400).\\n\\nCommunity pipeline PRs are only checked at a superficial level and ideally they should be maintained by their original authors.\\n\\nContributing a community pipeline is a great way to understand how Diffusers models and schedulers work. Having contributed a community pipeline is usually the first stepping stone to contributing an official pipeline to the\\ncore package.\\n\\n### 7. Contribute to training examples\\n\\nDiffusers examples are a collection of training scripts that reside in [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples).\\n\\nWe support two types of training examples:\\n\\n- Official training examples\\n- Research training examples\\n\\nResearch training examples are located in [examples/research_projects](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/research_projects) whereas official training examples include all folders under [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples) except the `research_projects` and `community` folders.\\nThe official training examples are maintained by the Diffusers' core maintainers whereas the research training examples are maintained by the community.\\nThis is because of the same reasons put forward in [6. Contribute a community pipeline](#6-contribute-a-community-pipeline) for official pipelines vs. community pipelines: It is not feasible for the core maintainers to maintain all possible training methods for diffusion models.\\nIf the Diffusers core maintainers and the community consider a certain training paradigm to be too experimental or not popular enough, the corresponding training code should be put in the `research_projects` folder and maintained by the author.\\n\\nBoth official training and research examples consist of a directory that contains one or more training scripts, a requirements.txt file, and a README.md file. In order for the user to make use of the\\ntraining examples, it is required to clone the repository:\\n\\n```bash\\ngit clone https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers\\n```\\n\\nas well as to install all additional dependencies required for training:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install -r /examples/<your-example-folder>/requirements.txt\\n```\\n\\nTherefore when adding an example, the `requirements.txt` file shall define all pip dependencies required for your training example so that once all those are installed, the user can run the example's training script. See, for example, the [DreamBooth `requirements.txt` file](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/dreambooth/requirements.txt).\\n\\nTraining examples of the Diffusers library should adhere to the following philosophy:\\n- All the code necessary to run the examples should be found in a single Python file.\\n- One should be able to run the example from the command line with `python <your-example>.py --args`.\\n- Examples should be kept simple and serve as **an example** on how to use Diffusers for training. The purpose of example scripts is **not** to create state-of-the-art diffusion models, but rather to reproduce known training schemes without adding too much custom logic. As a byproduct of this point, our examples also strive to serve as good educational materials.\\n\\nTo contribute an example, it is highly recommended to look at already existing examples such as [dreambooth](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/dreambooth/train_dreambooth.py) to get an idea of how they should look like.\\nWe strongly advise contributors to make use of the [Accelerate library](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) as it's tightly integrated\\nwith Diffusers.\\nOnce an example script works, please make sure to add a comprehensive `README.md` that states how to use the example exactly. This README should include:\\n- An example command on how to run the example script as shown [here e.g.](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/dreambooth#running-locally-with-pytorch).\\n- A link to some training results (logs, models, ...) that show what the user can expect as shown [here e.g.](https://api.wandb.ai/report/patrickvonplaten/xm6cd5q5).\\n- If you are adding a non-official/research training example, **please don't forget** to add a sentence that you are maintaining this training example which includes your git handle as shown [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/research_projects/intel_opts#diffusers-examples-with-intel-optimizations).\\n\\nIf you are contributing to the official training examples, please also make sure to add a test to [examples/test_examples.py](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/test_examples.py). This is not necessary for non-official training examples.\\n\\n### 8. Fixing a \"Good second issue\"\\n\\n*Good second issues* are marked by the [Good second issue](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+second+issue%22) label. Good second issues are\\nusually more complicated to solve than [Good first issues](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).\\nThe issue description usually gives less guidance on how to fix the issue and requires\\na decent understanding of the library by the interested contributor.\\nIf you are interested in tackling a good second issue, feel free to open a PR to fix it and link the PR to the issue. If you see that a PR has already been opened for this issue but did not get merged, have a look to understand why it wasn't merged and try to open an improved PR.\\nGood second issues are usually more difficult to get merged compared to good first issues, so don't hesitate to ask for help from the core maintainers. If your PR is almost finished the core maintainers can also jump into your PR and commit to it in order to get it merged.\\n\\n### 9. Adding pipelines, models, schedulers\\n\\nPipelines, models, and schedulers are the most important pieces of the Diffusers library.\\nThey provide easy access to state-of-the-art diffusion technologies and thus allow the community to\\nbuild powerful generative AI applications.\\n\\nBy adding a new model, pipeline, or scheduler you might enable a new powerful use case for any of the user interfaces relying on Diffusers which can be of immense value for the whole generative AI ecosystem.\\n\\nDiffusers has a couple of open feature requests for all three components - feel free to gloss over them\\nif you don't know yet what specific component you would like to add:\\n- [Model or pipeline](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22New+pipeline%2Fmodel%22)\\n- [Scheduler](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22New+scheduler%22)\\n\\nBefore adding any of the three components, it is strongly recommended that you give the [Philosophy guide](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/PHILOSOPHY.md) a read to better understand the design of any of the three components. Please be aware that\\nwe cannot merge model, scheduler, or pipeline additions that strongly diverge from our design philosophy\\nas it will lead to API inconsistencies. If you fundamentally disagree with a design choice, please\\nopen a [Feedback issue](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feedback.md&title=) instead so that it can be discussed whether a certain design\\npattern/design choice shall be changed everywhere in the library and whether we shall update our design philosophy. Consistency across the library is very important for us.\\n\\nPlease make sure to add links to the original codebase/paper to the PR and ideally also ping the\\noriginal author directly on the PR so that they can follow the progress and potentially help with questions.\\n\\nIf you are unsure or stuck in the PR, don't hesitate to leave a message to ask for a first review or help.\\n\\n## How to write a good issue\\n\\n**The better your issue is written, the higher the chances that it will be quickly resolved.**\\n\\n1. Make sure that you've used the correct template for your issue. You can pick between *Bug Report*, *Feature Request*, *Feedback about API Design*, *New model/pipeline/scheduler addition*, *Forum*, or a blank issue. Make sure to pick the correct one when opening [a new issue](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new/choose).\\n2. **Be precise**: Give your issue a fitting title. Try to formulate your issue description as simple as possible. The more precise you are when submitting an issue, the less time it takes to understand the issue and potentially solve it. Make sure to open an issue for one issue only and not for multiple issues. If you found multiple issues, simply open multiple issues. If your issue is a bug, try to be as precise as possible about what bug it is - you should not just write \"Error in diffusers\".\\n3. **Reproducibility**: No reproducible code snippet == no solution. If you encounter a bug, maintainers **have to be able to reproduce** it. Make sure that you include a code snippet that can be copy-pasted into a Python interpreter to reproduce the issue. Make sure that your code snippet works, *i.e.* that there are no missing imports or missing links to images, ... Your issue should contain an error message **and** a code snippet that can be copy-pasted without any changes to reproduce the exact same error message. If your issue is using local model weights or local data that cannot be accessed by the reader, the issue cannot be solved. If you cannot share your data or model, try to make a dummy model or dummy data.\\n4. **Minimalistic**: Try to help the reader as much as you can to understand the issue as quickly as possible by staying as concise as possible. Remove all code / all information that is irrelevant to the issue. If you have found a bug, try to create the easiest code example you can to demonstrate your issue, do not just dump your whole workflow into the issue as soon as you have found a bug. E.g., if you train a model and get an error at some point during the training, you should first try to understand what part of the training code is responsible for the error and try to reproduce it with a couple of lines. Try to use dummy data instead of full datasets.\\n5. Add links. If you are referring to a certain naming, method, or model make sure to provide a link so that the reader can better understand what you mean. If you are referring to a specific PR or issue, make sure to link it to your issue. Do not assume that the reader knows what you are talking about. The more links you add to your issue the better.\\n6. Formatting. Make sure to nicely format your issue by formatting code into Python code syntax, and error messages into normal code syntax. See the [official GitHub formatting docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for more information.\\n7. Think of your issue not as a ticket to be solved, but rather as a beautiful entry to a well-written encyclopedia. Every added issue is a contribution to publicly available knowledge. By adding a nicely written issue you not only make it easier for maintainers to solve your issue, but you are helping the whole community to better understand a certain aspect of the library.\\n\\n## How to write a good PR\\n\\n1. Be a chameleon. Understand existing design patterns and syntax and make sure your code additions flow seamlessly into the existing code base. Pull requests that significantly diverge from existing design patterns or user interfaces will not be merged.\\n2. Be laser focused. A pull request should solve one problem and one problem only. Make sure to not fall into the trap of \"also fixing another problem while we're adding it\". It is much more difficult to review pull requests that solve multiple, unrelated problems at once.\\n3. If helpful, try to add a code snippet that displays an example of how your addition can be used.\\n4. The title of your pull request should be a summary of its contribution.\\n5. If your pull request addresses an issue, please mention the issue number in\\nthe pull request description to make sure they are linked (and people\\nconsulting the issue know you are working on it);\\n6. To indicate a work in progress please prefix the title with `[WIP]`. These\\nare useful to avoid duplicated work, and to differentiate it from PRs ready\\nto be merged;\\n7. Try to formulate and format your text as explained in [How to write a good issue](#how-to-write-a-good-issue).\\n8. Make sure existing tests pass;\\n9. Add high-coverage tests. No quality testing = no merge.\\n- If you are adding new `@slow` tests, make sure they pass using\\n`RUN_SLOW=1 python -m pytest tests/test_my_new_model.py`.\\nCircleCI does not run the slow tests, but GitHub Actions does every night!\\n10. All public methods must have informative docstrings that work nicely with markdown. See [`pipeline_latent_diffusion.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/pipelines/latent_diffusion/pipeline_latent_diffusion.py) for an example.\\n11. Due to the rapidly growing repository, it is important to make sure that no files that would significantly weigh down the repository are added. This includes images, videos, and other non-text files. We prefer to leverage a hf.co hosted `dataset` like\\n[`hf-internal-testing`](https://huggingface.co/hf-internal-testing) or [huggingface/documentation-images](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images) to place these files.\\nIf an external contribution, feel free to add the images to your PR and ask a Hugging Face member to migrate your images\\nto this dataset.\\n\\n## How to open a PR\\n\\nBefore writing code, we strongly advise you to search through the existing PRs or\\nissues to make sure that nobody is already working on the same thing. If you are\\nunsure, it is always a good idea to open an issue to get some feedback.\\n\\nYou will need basic `git` proficiency to be able to contribute to\\n🧨 Diffusers. `git` is not the easiest tool to use but it has the greatest\\nmanual. Type `git --help` in a shell and enjoy. If you prefer books, [Pro\\nGit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a very good reference.\\n\\nFollow these steps to start contributing ([supported Python versions](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/setup.py#L265)):\\n\\n1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) by\\nclicking on the 'Fork' button on the repository's page. This creates a copy of the code\\nunder your GitHub user account.\\n\\n2. Clone your fork to your local disk, and add the base repository as a remote:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ git clone git@github.com:<your GitHub handle>/diffusers.git\\n $ cd diffusers\\n $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers.git\\n ```\\n\\n3. Create a new branch to hold your development changes:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ git checkout -b a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes\\n ```\\n\\n**Do not** work on the `main` branch.\\n\\n4. Set up a development environment by running the following command in a virtual environment:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ pip install -e \".[dev]\"\\n ```\\n\\nIf you have already cloned the repo, you might need to `git pull` to get the most recent changes in the\\nlibrary.\\n\\n5. Develop the features on your branch.\\n\\nAs you work on the features, you should make sure that the test suite\\npasses. You should run the tests impacted by your changes like this:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ pytest tests/<TEST_TO_RUN>.py\\n ```\\n\\nBefore you run the tests, please make sure you install the dependencies required for testing. You can do so\\nwith this command:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ pip install -e \".[test]\"\\n ```\\n\\nYou can also run the full test suite with the following command, but it takes\\na beefy machine to produce a result in a decent amount of time now that\\nDiffusers has grown a lot. Here is the command for it:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ make test\\n ```\\n\\n🧨 Diffusers relies on `ruff` and `isort` to format its source code\\nconsistently. After you make changes, apply automatic style corrections and code verifications\\nthat can't be automated in one go with:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ make style\\n ```\\n\\n🧨 Diffusers also uses `ruff` and a few custom scripts to check for coding mistakes. Quality\\ncontrol runs in CI, however, you can also run the same checks with:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ make quality\\n ```\\n\\nOnce you're happy with your changes, add changed files using `git add` and\\nmake a commit with `git commit` to record your changes locally:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ git add modified_file.py\\n $ git commit -m \"A descriptive message about your changes.\"\\n ```\\n\\nIt is a good idea to sync your copy of the code with the original\\nrepository regularly. This way you can quickly account for changes:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ git pull upstream main\\n ```\\n\\nPush the changes to your account using:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ git push -u origin a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes\\n ```\\n\\n6. Once you are satisfied, go to the\\nwebpage of your fork on GitHub. Click on 'Pull request' to send your changes\\nto the project maintainers for review.\\n\\n7. It's ok if maintainers ask you for changes. It happens to core contributors\\ntoo! So everyone can see the changes in the Pull request, work in your local\\nbranch and push the changes to your fork. They will automatically appear in\\nthe pull request.\\n\\n### Tests\\n\\nAn extensive test suite is included to test the library behavior and several examples. Library tests can be found in\\nthe [tests folder](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/tests).\\n\\nWe like `pytest` and `pytest-xdist` because it's faster. From the root of the\\nrepository, here's how to run tests with `pytest` for the library:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ python -m pytest -n auto --dist=loadfile -s -v ./tests/\\n```\\n\\nIn fact, that's how `make test` is implemented!\\n\\nYou can specify a smaller set of tests in order to test only the feature\\nyou're working on.\\n\\nBy default, slow tests are skipped. Set the `RUN_SLOW` environment variable to\\n`yes` to run them. This will download many gigabytes of models — make sure you\\nhave enough disk space and a good Internet connection, or a lot of patience!\\n\\n```bash\\n$ RUN_SLOW=yes python -m pytest -n auto --dist=loadfile -s -v ./tests/\\n```\\n\\n`unittest` is fully supported, here's how to run tests with it:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ python -m unittest discover -s tests -t . -v\\n$ python -m unittest discover -s examples -t examples -v\\n```\\n\\n### Syncing forked main with upstream (HuggingFace) main\\n\\nTo avoid pinging the upstream repository which adds reference notes to each upstream PR and sends unnecessary notifications to the developers involved in these PRs,\\nwhen syncing the main branch of a forked repository, please, follow these steps:\\n1. When possible, avoid syncing with the upstream using a branch and PR on the forked repository. Instead, merge directly into the forked main.\\n2. If a PR is absolutely necessary, use the following steps after checking out your branch:\\n```bash\\n$ git checkout -b your-branch-for-syncing\\n$ git pull --squash --no-commit upstream main\\n$ git commit -m '<your message without GitHub references>'\\n$ git push --set-upstream origin your-branch-for-syncing\\n```\\n\\n### Style guide\\n\\nFor documentation strings, 🧨 Diffusers follows the [Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).\\n   \n","2

                                                 Key Features\\n\\nLet's go through some of the key features of Gradio. This guide is intended to be a high-level overview of various things that you should be aware of as you build your demo. Where appropriate, we link to more detailed guides on specific topics.\\n\\n1. [Components](#components)\\n2. [Queuing](#queuing)\\n3. [Streaming outputs](#streaming-outputs)\\n4. [Streaming inputs](#streaming-inputs)\\n5. [Alert modals](#alert-modals)\\n6. [Styling](#styling)\\n7. [Progress bars](#progress-bars)\\n8. [Batch functions](#batch-functions)\\n\\n## Components\\n\\nGradio includes more than 30 pre-built components (as well as many user-built _custom components_) that can be used as inputs or outputs in your demo with a single line of code. These components correspond to common data types in machine learning and data science, e.g. the `gr.Image` component is designed to handle input or output images, the `gr.Label` component displays classification labels and probabilities, the `gr.Plot` component displays various kinds of plots, and so on.\\n\\nEach component includes various constructor attributes that control the properties of the component. For example, you can control the number of lines in a `gr.Textbox` using the `lines` argument (which takes a positive integer) in its constructor. Or you can control the way that a user can provide an image in the `gr.Image` component using the `sources` parameter (which takes a list like `[\"webcam\", \"upload\"]`).\\n\\n**Static and Interactive Components**\\n\\nEvery component has a _static_ version that is designed to *display* data, and most components also have an _interactive_ version designed to let users input or modify the data. Typically, you don't need to think about this distinction, because when you build a Gradio demo, Gradio automatically figures out whether the component should be static or interactive based on whether it is being used as an input or output. However, you can set this manually using the `interactive` argument that every component supports.\\n\\n**Preprocessing and Postprocessing**\\n\\nWhen a component is used as an input, Gradio automatically handles the _preprocessing_ needed to convert the data from a type sent by the user's browser (such as an uploaded image) to a form that can be accepted by your function (such as a `numpy` array).\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, when a component is used as an output, Gradio automatically handles the _postprocessing_ needed to convert the data from what is returned by your function (such as a list of image paths) to a form that can be displayed in the user's browser (a gallery of images).\\n\\nConsider an example demo with three input components (`gr.Textbox`, `gr.Number`, and `gr.Image`) and two outputs (`gr.Number` and `gr.Gallery`) that serve as a UI for your image-to-image generation model. Below is a diagram of what our preprocessing will send to the model and what our postprocessing will require from it.\\n\\n![](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/guides/assets/dataflow.svg?raw=true)\\n\\nIn this image, the following preprocessing steps happen to send the data from the browser to your function:\\n\\n* The text in the textbox is converted to a Python `str` (essentially no preprocessing)\\n* The number in the number input in converted to a Python `float` (essentially no preprocessing)\\n* Most importantly, ihe image supplied by the user is converted to a `numpy.array` representation of the RGB values in the image\\n\\nImages are converted to NumPy arrays because they are a common format for machine learning workflows. You can control the _preprocessing_ using the component's parameters when constructing the component. For example, if you instantiate the `Image` component with the following parameters, it will preprocess the image to the `PIL` format instead:\\n\\n```py\\nimg = gr.Image(type=\"pil\")\\n```\\n\\nPostprocessing is even simpler! Gradio automatically recognizes the format of the returned data (e.g. does the user's function return a `numpy` array or a `str` filepath for the `gr.Image` component?) and postprocesses it appropriately into a format that can be displayed by the browser.\\n\\nSo in the image above, the following postprocessing steps happen to send the data returned from a user's function to the browser:\\n\\n* The `float` is displayed as a number and displayed directly to the user\\n* The list of string filepaths (`list[str]`) is interpreted as a list of image filepaths and displayed as a gallery in the browser\\n\\nTake a look at the [Docs](https://gradio.app/docs) to see all the parameters for each Gradio component.\\n\\n## Queuing\\n\\nEvery Gradio app comes with a built-in queuing system that can scale to thousands of concurrent users. You can configure the queue by using `queue()` method which is supported by the `gr.Interface`, `gr.Blocks`, and `gr.ChatInterface` classes. \\n\\nFor example, you can control the number of requests processed at a single time by setting the `default_concurrency_limit` parameter of `queue()`, e.g.\\n\\n```python\\ndemo = gr.Interface(...).queue(default_concurrency_limit=5)\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\n\\nThis limits the number of requests processed for this event listener at a single time to 5. By default, the `default_concurrency_limit` is actually set to `1`, which means that when many users are using your app, only a single user's request will be processed at a time. This is because many machine learning functions consume a significant amount of memory and so it is only suitable to have a single user using the demo at a time. However, you can change this parameter in your demo easily.\\n\\nSee the [docs on queueing](/docs/interface#interface-queue) for more details on configuring the queuing parameters.\\n\\n## Streaming outputs\\n\\nIn some cases, you may want to stream a sequence of outputs rather than show a single output at once. For example, you might have an image generation model and you want to show the image that is generated at each step, leading up to the final image. Or you might have a chatbot which streams its response one token at a time instead of returning it all at once.\\n\\nIn such cases, you can supply a **generator** function into Gradio instead of a regular function. Creating generators in Python is very simple: instead of a single `return` value, a function should `yield` a series of values instead. Usually the `yield` statement is put in some kind of loop. Here's an example of an generator that simply counts up to a given number:\\n\\n```python\\ndef my_generator(x):\\n    for i in range(x):\\n        yield i\\n```\\n\\nYou supply a generator into Gradio the same way as you would a regular function. For example, here's a a (fake) image generation model that generates noise for several steps before outputting an image using the `gr.Interface` class:\\n\\n$code_fake_diffusion\\n$demo_fake_diffusion\\n\\nNote that we've added a `time.sleep(1)` in the iterator to create an artificial pause between steps so that you are able to observe the steps of the iterator (in a real image generation model, this probably wouldn't be necessary).\\n\\n## Streaming inputs\\n\\nSimilarly, Gradio can handle streaming inputs, e.g. a live audio stream that can gets transcribed to text in real time, or an image generation model that reruns every time a user types a letter in a textbox. This is covered in more details in our guide on building [reactive Interfaces](/guides/reactive-interfaces). \\n\\n## Alert modals\\n\\nYou may wish to raise alerts to the user. To do so, raise a `gr.Error(\"custom message\")` to display an error message. You can also issue `gr.Warning(\"message\")` and `gr.Info(\"message\")` by having them as standalone lines in your function, which will immediately display modals while continuing the execution of your function. Queueing needs to be enabled for this to work.\\n\\nNote below how the `gr.Error` has to be raised, while the `gr.Warning` and `gr.Info` are single lines.\\n\\n```python\\ndef start_process(name):\\n    gr.Info(\"Starting process\")\\n    if name is None:\\n        gr.Warning(\"Name is empty\")\\n    ...\\n    if success == False:\\n        raise gr.Error(\"Process failed\")\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n## Styling\\n\\nGradio themes are the easiest way to customize the look and feel of your app. You can choose from a variety of themes, or create your own. To do so, pass the `theme=` kwarg to the `Interface` constructor. For example:\\n\\n```python\\ndemo = gr.Interface(..., theme=gr.themes.Monochrome())\\n```\\n\\nGradio comes with a set of prebuilt themes which you can load from `gr.themes.*`. You can extend these themes or create your own themes from scratch - see the [theming guide](https://gradio.app/guides/theming-guide) for more details.\\n\\nFor additional styling ability, you can pass any CSS (as well as custom JavaScript) to your Gradio application. This is discussed in more detail in our [custom JS and CSS guide](/guides/custom-CSS-and-JS).\\n\\n\\n## Progress bars\\n\\nGradio supports the ability to create custom Progress Bars so that you have customizability and control over the progress update that you show to the user. In order to enable this, simply add an argument to your method that has a default value of a `gr.Progress` instance. Then you can update the progress levels by calling this instance directly with a float between 0 and 1, or using the `tqdm()` method of the `Progress` instance to track progress over an iterable, as shown below.\\n\\n$code_progress_simple\\n$demo_progress_simple\\n\\nIf you use the `tqdm` library, you can even report progress updates automatically from any `tqdm.tqdm` that already exists within your function by setting the default argument as `gr.Progress(track_tqdm=True)`!\\n\\n## Batch functions\\n\\nGradio supports the ability to pass _batch_ functions. Batch functions are just\\nfunctions which take in a list of inputs and return a list of predictions.\\n\\nFor example, here is a batched function that takes in two lists of inputs (a list of\\nwords and a list of ints), and returns a list of trimmed words as output:\\n\\n```py\\nimport time\\n\\ndef trim_words(words, lens):\\n    trimmed_words = []\\n    time.sleep(5)\\n    for w, l in zip(words, lens):\\n        trimmed_words.append(w[:int(l)])\\n    return [trimmed_words]\\n```\\n\\nThe advantage of using batched functions is that if you enable queuing, the Gradio server can automatically _batch_ incoming requests and process them in parallel,\\npotentially speeding up your demo. Here's what the Gradio code looks like (notice the `batch=True` and `max_batch_size=16`)\\n\\nWith the `gr.Interface` class:\\n\\n```python\\ndemo = gr.Interface(\\n    fn=trim_words, \\n    inputs=[\"textbox\", \"number\"], \\n    outputs=[\"output\"],\\n    batch=True, \\n    max_batch_size=16\\n)\\n\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\n\\nWith the `gr.Blocks` class:\\n\\n```py\\nimport gradio as gr\\n\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\n    with gr.Row():\\n        word = gr.Textbox(label=\"word\")\\n        leng = gr.Number(label=\"leng\")\\n        output = gr.Textbox(label=\"Output\")\\n    with gr.Row():\\n        run = gr.Button()\\n\\n    event = run.click(trim_words, [word, leng], output, batch=True, max_batch_size=16)\\n\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\n\\nIn the example above, 16 requests could be processed in parallel (for a total inference time of 5 seconds), instead of each request being processed separately (for a total\\ninference time of 80 seconds). Many Hugging Face `transformers` and `diffusers` models work very naturally with Gradio's batch mode: here's [an example demo using diffusers to\\ngenerate images in batches](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/demo/diffusers_with_batching/run.py)\\n\\n\\n   \n","3

In this paper we propose a new model architecture DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with\\ndisentangled attention) that improves the BERT and RoBERTa models using two novel techniques. The first is the\\ndisentangled attention mechanism, where each word is represented using two vectors that encode its content and\\nposition, respectively, and the attention weights among words are computed using disentangled matrices on their\\ncontents and relative positions. Second, an enhanced mask decoder is used to replace the output softmax layer to\\npredict the masked tokens for model pretraining. We show that these two techniques significantly improve the efficiency\\nof model pretraining and performance of downstream tasks. Compared to RoBERTa-Large, a DeBERTa model trained on half of\\nthe training data performs consistently better on a wide range of NLP tasks, achieving improvements on MNLI by +0.9%\\n(90.2% vs. 91.1%), on SQuAD v2.0 by +2.3% (88.4% vs. 90.7%) and RACE by +3.6% (83.2% vs. 86.8%). The DeBERTa code and\\npre-trained models will be made publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/DeBERTa.*\\n\\n\\nThe following information is visible directly on the [original implementation\\nrepository](https://github.com/microsoft/DeBERTa). DeBERTa v2 is the second version of the DeBERTa model. It includes\\nthe 1.5B model used for the SuperGLUE single-model submission and achieving 89.9, versus human baseline 89.8. You can\\nfind more details about this submission in the authors'\\n[blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/microsoft-deberta-surpasses-human-performance-on-the-superglue-benchmark/)\\n\\nNew in v2:\\n\\n- **Vocabulary** In v2 the tokenizer is changed to use a new vocabulary of size 128K built from the training data.\\n  Instead of a GPT2-based tokenizer, the tokenizer is now\\n  [sentencepiece-based](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) tokenizer.\\n- **nGiE(nGram Induced Input Encoding)** The DeBERTa-v2 model uses an additional convolution layer aside with the first\\n  transformer layer to better learn the local dependency of input tokens.\\n- **Sharing position projection matrix with content projection matrix in attention layer** Based on previous\\n  experiments, this can save parameters without affecting the performance.\\n- **Apply bucket to encode relative positions** The DeBERTa-v2 model uses log bucket to encode relative positions\\n  similar to T5.\\n- **900M model & 1.5B model** Two additional model sizes are available: 900M and 1.5B, which significantly improves the\\n  performance of downstream tasks.\\n\\nThis model was contributed by [DeBERTa](https://huggingface.co/DeBERTa).

defer src=\"https://unpkg.com/medium-zoom-element@0/dist/medium-zoom-element.min.js\"></script>\\n\\n**This guide introduces Mask2Former and OneFormer, 2 state-of-the-art neural networks for image segmentation. The models are now available in [`🤗 transformers`](https://huggingface.co/transformers), an open-source library that offers easy-to-use implementations of state-of-the-art models. Along the way, you'll learn about the difference between the various forms of image segmentation.**\\n\\n## Image segmentation\\n\\nImage segmentation is the task of identifying different \"segments\" in an image, like people or cars. More technically, image segmentation is the task of grouping pixels with different semantics. Refer to the Hugging Face [task page](https://huggingface.co/tasks/image-segmentation) for a brief introduction.\\n\\nImage segmentation can largely be split into 3 subtasks - instance, semantic and panoptic segmentation - with numerous methods and model architectures to perform each subtask.\\n\\n- **instance segmentation** is the task of identifying different \"instances\", like individual people, in an image. Instance segmentation is very similar to object detection, except that we'd like to output a set of binary segmentation masks, rather than bounding boxes, with corresponding class labels. Instances are oftentimes also called \"objects\" or \"things\". Note that individual instances may overlap.\\n- **semantic segmentation** is the task of identifying different \"semantic categories\", like \"person\" or \"sky\" of each pixel in an image. Contrary to instance segmentation, no distinction is made between individual instances of a given semantic category; one just likes to come up with a mask for the \"person\" category, rather than for the individual people for example. Semantic categories which don't have individual instances, like \"sky\" or \"grass\", are oftentimes referred to as \"stuff\", to make the distinction with \"things\" (great names, huh?). Note that no overlap between semantic categories is possible, as each pixel belongs to one category.\\n- **panoptic segmentation**, introduced in 2018 by [Kirillov et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00868), aims to unify instance and semantic segmentation, by making models simply identify a set of \"segments\", each with a corresponding binary mask and class label. Segments can be both \"things\" or \"stuff\". Unlike in instance segmentation, no overlap between different segments is possible.\\n\\nThe figure below illustrates the difference between the 3 subtasks (taken from [this blog post](https://www.v7labs.com/blog/panoptic-segmentation-guide)).\\n\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n    <img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/127_mask2former/semantic_vs_semantic_vs_panoptic.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=500>\\n</p>\\n\\nOver the last years, researchers have come up with several architectures that were typically very tailored to either instance, semantic or panoptic segmentation. Instance and panoptic segmentation were typically solved by outputting a set of binary masks + corresponding labels per object instance (very similar to object detection, except that one outputs a binary mask instead of a bounding box per instance). This is oftentimes called \"binary mask classification\". Semantic segmentation on the other hand was typically solved by making models output a single \"segmentation map\" with one label per pixel. Hence, semantic segmentation was treated as a \"per-pixel classification\" problem. Popular semantic segmentation models which adopt this paradigm are [SegFormer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/segformer), on which we wrote an extensive [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-segformer), and [UPerNet](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/upernet).\\n\\n## Universal image segmentation\\n\\nLuckily, since around 2020, people started to come up with models that can solve all 3 tasks (instance, semantic and panoptic segmentation) with a unified architecture, using the same paradigm. This started with [DETR](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/detr), which was the first model that solved panoptic segmentation using a \"binary mask classification\" paradigm, by treating \"things\" and \"stuff\" classes in a unified way. The key innovation was to have a Transformer decoder come up with a set of binary masks + classes in a parallel way. This was then improved in the [MaskFormer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/maskformer) paper, which showed that the \"binary mask classification\" paradigm also works really well for semantic segmentation.\\n\\n[Mask2Former](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/mask2former) extends this to instance segmentation by further improving the neural network architecture. Hence, we've evolved from separate architectures to what researchers now refer to as \"universal image segmentation\" architectures, capable of solving any image segmentation task. Interestingly, these universal models all adopt the \"mask classification\" paradigm, discarding the \"per-pixel classification\" paradigm entirely. A figure illustrating Mask2Former's architecture is depicted below (taken from the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01527)).\\n\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n    <img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/mask2former_architecture.jpg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=500>\\n</p>\\n\\nIn short, an image is first sent through a backbone (which, in the paper could be either [ResNet](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/resnet) or [Swin Transformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/swin)) to get a list of low-resolution feature maps. Next, these feature maps are enhanced using a pixel decoder module to get high-resolution features. Finally, a Transformer decoder takes in a set of queries and transforms them into a set of binary mask and class predictions, conditioned on the pixel decoder's features.\\n\\nNote that Mask2Former still needs to be trained on each task separately to obtain state-of-the-art results. This has been improved by the [OneFormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06220) model, which obtains state-of-the-art performance on all 3 tasks by only training on a panoptic version of the dataset (!), by adding a text encoder to condition the model on either \"instance\", \"semantic\" or \"panoptic\" inputs. This model is also as of today [available in 🤗 transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/oneformer). It's even more accurate than Mask2Former, but comes with greater latency due to the additional text encoder. See the figure below for an overview of OneFormer. It leverages either Swin Transformer or the new [DiNAT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/dinat) model as backbone.\\n\\n<p align=\"center\">\\n    <img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/oneformer_architecture.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=500>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Inference with Mask2Former and OneFormer in Transformers\\n\\nUsage of Mask2Former and OneFormer is pretty straightforward, and very similar to their predecessor MaskFormer. Let's instantiate a Mask2Former model from the hub trained on the COCO panoptic dataset, along with its processor. Note that the authors released no less than [30 checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/models?other=mask2former) trained on various datasets.\\n\\n```\\nfrom transformers import AutoImageProcessor, Mask2FormerForUniversalSegmentation\\n\\nprocessor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained(\"facebook/mask2former-swin-base-coco-panoptic\")\\nmodel = Mask2FormerForUniversalSegmentation.from_pretrained(\"facebook/mask2former-swin-base-coco-panoptic\")\\n```\\n\\nNext, let's load the familiar cats image from the COCO dataset, on which we'll perform inference.\\n\\n```\\nfrom PIL import Image\\n\\nurl = \"http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg\"\\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\\nimage\\n```\\n\\n<img src=\"assets/78_annotated-diffusion/output_cats.jpeg\" width=\"400\" />\\n\\nWe prepare the image for the model using the image processor, and forward it through the model.\\n\\n```\\ninputs = processor(image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\\n\\nwith torch.no_grad():\\n    outputs = model(**inputs)\\n```\\n\\nThe model outputs a set of binary masks and corresponding class logits. The raw outputs of Mask2Former can be easily postprocessed using the image processor to get the final instance, semantic or panoptic segmentation predictions:\\n\\n```\\nprediction = processor.post_process_panoptic_segmentation(outputs, target_sizes=[image.size[::-1]])[0]\\nprint(prediction.keys())\\n```\\n<div class=\"output stream stdout\">\\n\\n    Output:\\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    dict_keys(['segmentation', 'segments_info'])\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nIn panoptic segmentation, the final `prediction` contains 2 things: a `segmentation` map of shape (height, width) where each value encodes the instance ID of a given pixel, as well as a corresponding `segments_info`. The  `segments_info` contains more information about the individual segments of the map (such as their class / category ID). Note that Mask2Former outputs binary mask proposals of shape (96, 96) for efficiency and the `target_sizes` argument is used to resize the final mask to the original image size.\\n\\nLet's visualize the results:\\n\\n```\\nfrom collections import defaultdict\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nimport matplotlib.patches as mpatches\\nfrom matplotlib import cm\\n\\ndef draw_panoptic_segmentation(segmentation, segments_info):\\n    # get the used color map\\n    viridis = cm.get_cmap('viridis', torch.max(segmentation))\\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots()\\n    ax.imshow(segmentation)\\n    instances_counter = defaultdict(int)\\n    handles = []\\n    # for each segment, draw its legend\\n    for segment in segments_info:\\n        segment_id = segment['id']\\n        segment_label_id = segment['label_id']\\n        segment_label = model.config.id2label[segment_label_id]\\n        label = f\"{segment_label}-{instances_counter[segment_label_id]}\"\\n        instances_counter[segment_label_id] += 1\\n        color = viridis(segment_id)\\n        handles.append(mpatches.Patch(color=color, label=label))\\n        \\n    ax.legend(handles=handles)\\n\\ndraw_panoptic_segmentation(**panoptic_segmentation)\\n```\\n\\n<img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/127_mask2former/cats_panoptic_result.png\" width=\"400\" />\\n\\nHere, we can see that the model is capable of detecting the individual cats and remotes in the image. Semantic segmentation on the other hand would just create a single mask for the \"cat\" category.\\n\\nTo perform inference with OneFormer, which has an identical API except that it also takes an additional text prompt as input, we refer to the [demo notebook](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/tree/master/OneFormer).\\n\\n## Fine-tuning Mask2Former and OneFormer in Transformers\\n\\nFor fine-tuning Mask2Former/OneFormer on a custom dataset for either instance, semantic and panoptic segmentation, check out our [demo notebooks](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/tree/master/MaskFormer/Fine-tuning). MaskFormer, Mask2Former and OneFormer share a similar API so upgrading from MaskFormer is easy and requires minimal changes.\\n\\nThe demo notebooks make use of `MaskFormerForInstanceSegmentation` to load the model whereas you'll have to switch to using either `Mask2FormerForUniversalSegmentation` or `OneFormerForUniversalSegmentation`. In case of image processing for Mask2Former, you'll also have to switch to using `Mask2FormerImageProcessor`. You can also load the image processor using the `AutoImageProcessor` class which automatically takes care of loading the correct processor corresponding to your model. OneFormer on the other hand requires a `OneFormerProcessor`, which prepares the images, along with a text input, for the model.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThat's it! You now know about the difference between instance, semantic and panoptic segmentation, as well as how to use \"universal architectures\" such as Mask2Former and OneFormer using the [🤗 transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers) library.\\n\\nWe hope you enjoyed this post and learned something.

Mixture of Experts (MoE) defies this and instead selects different parameters for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model -- with outrageous numbers of parameters -- but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs and training instability -- we address these with the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques help wrangle the instabilities and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the first time, with lower precision (bfloat16) formats. We design models based off T5-Base and T5-Large to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the \"Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus\" and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model.\"

A routing mechanism (top 1 in this case) associates each token to one of the expert, where each expert is a dense MLP. While switch transformers have a lot more weights than their equivalent dense models, the sparsity allows better scaling and better finetuning performance at scale.\\nDuring a forward pass, only a fraction of the weights are used. The routing mechanism allows the model to select relevant weights on the fly which increases the model capacity without increasing the number of operations.\\n\\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:\\n\\n*In deep learning, models typically reuse the same parameters for all inputs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) defies this and instead selects different parameters for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model -- with outrageous numbers of parameters -- but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs and training instability -- we address these with the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques help wrangle the instabilities and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the first time, with lower precision (bfloat16) formats. We design models based off T5-Base and T5-Large to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the \"Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus\" and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model.*\\n\\nThis model was contributed by [Younes Belkada](https://huggingface.co/ybelkada) and [Arthur Zucker](https://huggingface.co/ArthurZ).\\nThe original code can be found [here](https://github.com/google/flaxformer/tree/main/flaxformer/architectures/moe).\\n\\n## Usage tips\\n\\n- SwitchTransformers uses the [`T5Tokenizer`], which can be loaded directly from each model's repository.\\n- The released weights are pretrained on English [Masked Language Modeling](https://moon-ci-docs.huggingface.co/docs/transformers/pr_19323/en/glossary#general-terms) task, and should be finetuned.\\n\\n## Resources\\n\\n- [Translation task guide](../tasks/translation)\\n- [Summarization task guide](../tasks/summarization)\\n\\n## SwitchTransformersConfig\\n\\n[[autodoc]] SwitchTransformersConfig\\n\\n## SwitchTransformersTop1Router\\n\\n[[autodoc]] SwitchTransformersTop1Router\\n    - _compute_router_probabilities\\n    - forward\\n\\n## SwitchTransformersSparseMLP\\n\\n[[autodoc]] SwitchTransformersSparseMLP\\n    - forward\\n\\n## SwitchTransformersModel\\n\\n[[autodoc]] SwitchTransformersModel\\n    - forward\\n\\n## SwitchTransformersForConditionalGeneration\\n\\n[[autodoc]] SwitchTransformersForConditionalGeneration\\n    - forward\\n\\n## SwitchTransformersEncoderModel\\n\\n[[autodoc]] SwitchTransformersEncoderModel\\n    - forward\\n</td>\n","      <td>What is the abstract of the paper \"Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity\"?\\n</td>\n","      <td>The abstract of the paper \"Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity\" is the following: \"In deep learning, models typically reuse the same parameters for all inputs.

Everyone is welcome, and all types of participation –not just code– are valued and appreciated. Answering questions, helping others, reaching out, and improving the documentation are all immensely valuable to the community, so don't be afraid and get involved if you're up for it!\\n\\nEveryone is encouraged to start by saying 👋 in our public Discord channel. We discuss the latest trends in diffusion models, ask questions, show off personal projects, help each other with contributions, or just hang out ☕. &lt;a href=\"https://discord.gg/G7tWnz98XR\"&gt;&lt;img alt=\"Join us on Discord\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/discord/823813159592001537?color=5865F2&amp;logo=Discord&amp;logoColor=white\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\\n\\nWhichever way you choose to contribute, we strive to be part of an open, welcoming, and kind community. Please, read our [code of conduct](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and be mindful to respect it during your interactions. We also recommend you become familiar with the [ethical guidelines](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/ethical_guidelines) that guide our project and ask you to adhere to the same principles of transparency and responsibility.\\n\\nWe enormously value feedback from the community, so please do not be afraid to speak up if you believe you have valuable feedback that can help improve the library - every message, comment, issue, and pull request (PR) is read and considered.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nYou can contribute in many ways ranging from answering questions on issues to adding new diffusion models to\\nthe core library.\\n\\nIn the following, we give an overview of different ways to contribute, ranked by difficulty in ascending order. All of them are valuable to the community.\\n\\n* 1. Asking and answering questions on [the Diffusers discussion forum](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/discussion-related-to-httpsgithubcomhuggingfacediffusers) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/G7tWnz98XR).\\n* 2. Opening new issues on [the GitHub Issues tab](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new/choose).\\n* 3. Answering issues on [the GitHub Issues tab](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues).\\n* 4. Fix a simple issue, marked by the \"Good first issue\" label, see [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).\\n* 5. Contribute to the [documentation](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/docs/source).\\n* 6. Contribute a [Community Pipeline](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Acommunity-examples).\\n* 7. Contribute to the [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples).\\n* 8. Fix a more difficult issue, marked by the \"Good second issue\" label, see [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+second+issue%22).\\n* 9. Add a new pipeline, model, or scheduler, see [\"New Pipeline/Model\"](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22New+pipeline%2Fmodel%22) and [\"New scheduler\"](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22New+scheduler%22) issues. For this contribution, please have a look at [Design Philosophy](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/PHILOSOPHY.md).\\n\\nAs said before, **all contributions are valuable to the community**.\\nIn the following, we will explain each contribution a bit more in detail.\\n\\nFor all contributions 4-9, you will need to open a PR. It is explained in detail how to do so in [Opening a pull request](#how-to-open-a-pr).\\n\\n### 1. Asking and answering questions on the Diffusers discussion forum or on the Diffusers Discord\\n\\nAny question or comment related to the Diffusers library can be asked on the [discussion forum](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/discussion-related-to-httpsgithubcomhuggingfacediffusers/) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/G7tWnz98XR). Such questions and comments include (but are not limited to):\\n- Reports of training or inference experiments in an attempt to share knowledge\\n- Presentation of personal projects\\n- Questions to non-official training examples\\n- Project proposals\\n- General feedback\\n- Paper summaries\\n- Asking for help on personal projects that build on top of the Diffusers library\\n- General questions\\n- Ethical questions regarding diffusion models\\n- ...\\n\\nEvery question that is asked on the forum or on Discord actively encourages the community to publicly\\nshare knowledge and might very well help a beginner in the future that has the same question you're\\nhaving. Please do pose any questions you might have.\\nIn the same spirit, you are of immense help to the community by answering such questions because this way you are publicly documenting knowledge for everybody to learn from.\\n\\n**Please** keep in mind that the more effort you put into asking or answering a question, the higher\\nthe quality of the publicly documented knowledge. In the same way, well-posed and well-answered questions create a high-quality knowledge database accessible to everybody, while badly posed questions or answers reduce the overall quality of the public knowledge database.\\nIn short, a high quality question or answer is *precise*, *concise*, *relevant*, *easy-to-understand*, *accessible*, and *well-formated/well-posed*. For more information, please have a look through the [How to write a good issue](#how-to-write-a-good-issue) section.\\n\\n**NOTE about channels**:\\n[*The forum*](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/discussion-related-to-httpsgithubcomhuggingfacediffusers/63) is much better indexed by search engines, such as Google. Posts are ranked by popularity rather than chronologically. Hence, it's easier to look up questions and answers that we posted some time ago.\\nIn addition, questions and answers posted in the forum can easily be linked to.\\nIn contrast, *Discord* has a chat-like format that invites fast back-and-forth communication.\\nWhile it will most likely take less time for you to get an answer to your question on Discord, your\\nquestion won't be visible anymore over time. Also, it's much harder to find information that was posted a while back on Discord. We therefore strongly recommend using the forum for high-quality questions and answers in an attempt to create long-lasting knowledge for the community. If discussions on Discord lead to very interesting answers and conclusions, we recommend posting the results on the forum to make the information more available for future readers.\\n\\n### 2. Opening new issues on the GitHub issues tab\\n\\nThe 🧨 Diffusers library is robust and reliable thanks to the users who notify us of\\nthe problems they encounter. So thank you for reporting an issue.\\n\\nRemember, GitHub issues are reserved for technical questions directly related to the Diffusers library, bug reports, feature requests, or feedback on the library design.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, this means that everything that is **not** related to the **code of the Diffusers library** (including the documentation) should **not** be asked on GitHub, but rather on either the [forum](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/discussion-related-to-httpsgithubcomhuggingfacediffusers/63) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/G7tWnz98XR).\\n\\n**Please consider the following guidelines when opening a new issue**:\\n- Make sure you have searched whether your issue has already been asked before (use the search bar on GitHub under Issues).\\n- Please never report a new issue on another (related) issue. If another issue is highly related, please\\nopen a new issue nevertheless and link to the related issue.\\n- Make sure your issue is written in English. Please use one of the great, free online translation services, such as [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) to translate from your native language to English if you are not comfortable in English.\\n- Check whether your issue might be solved by updating to the newest Diffusers version. Before posting your issue, please make sure that `python -c \"import diffusers; print(diffusers.__version__)\"` is higher or matches the latest Diffusers version.\\n- Remember that the more effort you put into opening a new issue, the higher the quality of your answer will be and the better the overall quality of the Diffusers issues.\\n\\nNew issues usually include the following.\\n\\n#### 2.1. Reproducible, minimal bug reports\\n\\nA bug report should always have a reproducible code snippet and be as minimal and concise as possible.\\nThis means in more detail:\\n- Narrow the bug down as much as you can, **do not just dump your whole code file**.\\n- Format your code.\\n- Do not include any external libraries except for Diffusers depending on them.\\n- **Always** provide all necessary information about your environment; for this, you can run: `diffusers-cli env` in your shell and copy-paste the displayed information to the issue.\\n- Explain the issue. If the reader doesn't know what the issue is and why it is an issue, she cannot solve it.\\n- **Always** make sure the reader can reproduce your issue with as little effort as possible. If your code snippet cannot be run because of missing libraries or undefined variables, the reader cannot help you. Make sure your reproducible code snippet is as minimal as possible and can be copy-pasted into a simple Python shell.\\n- If in order to reproduce your issue a model and/or dataset is required, make sure the reader has access to that model or dataset. You can always upload your model or dataset to the [Hub](https://huggingface.co) to make it easily downloadable. Try to keep your model and dataset as small as possible, to make the reproduction of your issue as effortless as possible.\\n\\nFor more information, please have a look through the [How to write a good issue](#how-to-write-a-good-issue) section.\\n\\nYou can open a bug report [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=bug&amp;projects=&amp;template=bug-report.yml).\\n\\n#### 2.2. Feature requests\\n\\nA world-class feature request addresses the following points:\\n\\n1. Motivation first:\\n* Is it related to a problem/frustration with the library? If so, please explain\\nwhy. Providing a code snippet that demonstrates the problem is best.\\n* Is it related to something you would need for a project? We'd love to hear\\nabout it!\\n* Is it something you worked on and think could benefit the community?\\nAwesome! Tell us what problem it solved for you.\\n2. Write a *full paragraph* describing the feature;\\n3. Provide a **code snippet** that demonstrates its future use;\\n4. In case this is related to a paper, please attach a link;\\n5. Attach any additional information (drawings, screenshots, etc.) you think may help.\\n\\nYou can open a feature request [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=feature_request.md&amp;title=).\\n\\n#### 2.3 Feedback\\n\\nFeedback about the library design and why it is good or not good helps the core maintainers immensely to build a user-friendly library. To understand the philosophy behind the current design philosophy, please have a look [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/philosophy). If you feel like a certain design choice does not fit with the current design philosophy, please explain why and how it should be changed. If a certain design choice follows the design philosophy too much, hence restricting use cases, explain why and how it should be changed.\\nIf a certain design choice is very useful for you, please also leave a note as this is great feedback for future design decisions.\\n\\nYou can open an issue about feedback [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=feedback.md&amp;title=).\\n\\n#### 2.4 Technical questions\\n\\nTechnical questions are mainly about why certain code of the library was written in a certain way, or what a certain part of the code does. Please make sure to link to the code in question and please provide detail on\\nwhy this part of the code is difficult to understand.\\n\\nYou can open an issue about a technical question [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=bug&amp;template=bug-report.yml).\\n\\n#### 2.5 Proposal to add a new model, scheduler, or pipeline\\n\\nIf the diffusion model community released a new model, pipeline, or scheduler that you would like to see in the Diffusers library, please provide the following information:\\n\\n* Short description of the diffusion pipeline, model, or scheduler and link to the paper or public release.\\n* Link to any of its open-source implementation.\\n* Link to the model weights if they are available.\\n\\nIf you are willing to contribute to the model yourself, let us know so we can best guide you. Also, don't forget\\nto tag the original author of the component (model, scheduler, pipeline, etc.) by GitHub handle if you can find it.\\n\\nYou can open a request for a model/pipeline/scheduler [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=New+model%2Fpipeline%2Fscheduler&amp;template=new-model-addition.yml).\\n\\n### 3. Answering issues on the GitHub issues tab\\n\\nAnswering issues on GitHub might require some technical knowledge of Diffusers, but we encourage everybody to give it a try even if you are not 100% certain that your answer is correct.\\nSome tips to give a high-quality answer to an issue:\\n- Be as concise and minimal as possible.\\n- Stay on topic. An answer to the issue should concern the issue and only the issue.\\n- Provide links to code, papers, or other sources that prove or encourage your point.\\n- Answer in code. If a simple code snippet is the answer to the issue or shows how the issue can be solved, please provide a fully reproducible code snippet.\\n\\nAlso, many issues tend to be simply off-topic, duplicates of other issues, or irrelevant. It is of great\\nhelp to the maintainers if you can answer such issues, encouraging the author of the issue to be\\nmore precise, provide the link to a duplicated issue or redirect them to [the forum](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/discussion-related-to-httpsgithubcomhuggingfacediffusers/63) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/G7tWnz98XR).\\n\\nIf you have verified that the issued bug report is correct and requires a correction in the source code,\\nplease have a look at the next sections.\\n\\nFor all of the following contributions, you will need to open a PR. It is explained in detail how to do so in the [Opening a pull request](#how-to-open-a-pr) section.\\n\\n### 4. Fixing a \"Good first issue\"\\n\\n*Good first issues* are marked by the [Good first issue](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label. Usually, the issue already\\nexplains how a potential solution should look so that it is easier to fix.\\nIf the issue hasn't been closed and you would like to try to fix this issue, you can just leave a message \"I would like to try this issue.\". There are usually three scenarios:\\n- a.) The issue description already proposes a fix. In this case and if the solution makes sense to you, you can open a PR or draft PR to fix it.\\n- b.) The issue description does not propose a fix. In this case, you can ask what a proposed fix could look like and someone from the Diffusers team should answer shortly. If you have a good idea of how to fix it, feel free to directly open a PR.\\n- c.) There is already an open PR to fix the issue, but the issue hasn't been closed yet. If the PR has gone stale, you can simply open a new PR and link to the stale PR. PRs often go stale if the original contributor who wanted to fix the issue suddenly cannot find the time anymore to proceed. This often happens in open-source and is very normal. In this case, the community will be very happy if you give it a new try and leverage the knowledge of the existing PR. If there is already a PR and it is active, you can help the author by giving suggestions, reviewing the PR or even asking whether you can contribute to the PR.\\n\\n\\n### 5. Contribute to the documentation\\n\\nA good library **always** has good documentation! The official documentation is often one of the first points of contact for new users of the library, and therefore contributing to the documentation is a **highly\\nvaluable contribution**.\\n\\nContributing to the library can have many forms:\\n\\n- Correcting spelling or grammatical errors.\\n- Correct incorrect formatting of the docstring. If you see that the official documentation is weirdly displayed or a link is broken, we are very happy if you take some time to correct it.\\n- Correct the shape or dimensions of a docstring input or output tensor.\\n- Clarify documentation that is hard to understand or incorrect.\\n- Update outdated code examples.\\n- Translating the documentation to another language.\\n\\nAnything displayed on [the official Diffusers doc page](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index) is part of the official documentation and can be corrected, adjusted in the respective [documentation source](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/docs/source).\\n\\nPlease have a look at [this page](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/docs) on how to verify changes made to the documentation locally.\\n\\n\\n### 6. Contribute a community pipeline\\n\\n[Pipelines](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/overview) are usually the first point of contact between the Diffusers library and the user.\\nPipelines are examples of how to use Diffusers [models](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/models/overview) and [schedulers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/schedulers/overview).\\nWe support two types of pipelines:\\n\\n- Official Pipelines\\n- Community Pipelines\\n\\nBoth official and community pipelines follow the same design and consist of the same type of components.\\n\\nOfficial pipelines are tested and maintained by the core maintainers of Diffusers. Their code\\nresides in [src/diffusers/pipelines](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/src/diffusers/pipelines).\\nIn contrast, community pipelines are contributed and maintained purely by the **community** and are **not** tested.\\nThey reside in [examples/community](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/community) and while they can be accessed via the [PyPI diffusers package](https://pypi.org/project/diffusers/), their code is not part of the PyPI distribution.\\n\\nThe reason for the distinction is that the core maintainers of the Diffusers library cannot maintain and test all\\npossible ways diffusion models can be used for inference, but some of them may be of interest to the community.\\nOfficially released diffusion pipelines,\\nsuch as Stable Diffusion are added to the core src/diffusers/pipelines package which ensures\\nhigh quality of maintenance, no backward-breaking code changes, and testing.\\nMore bleeding edge pipelines should be added as community pipelines. If usage for a community pipeline is high, the pipeline can be moved to the official pipelines upon request from the community. This is one of the ways we strive to be a community-driven library.\\n\\nTo add a community pipeline, one should add a &lt;name-of-the-community&gt;.py file to [examples/community](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/community) and adapt the [examples/community/README.md](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/community/README.md) to include an example of the new pipeline.\\n\\nAn example can be seen [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/2400).\\n\\nCommunity pipeline PRs are only checked at a superficial level and ideally they should be maintained by their original authors.\\n\\nContributing a community pipeline is a great way to understand how Diffusers models and schedulers work. Having contributed a community pipeline is usually the first stepping stone to contributing an official pipeline to the\\ncore package.\\n\\n### 7. Contribute to training examples\\n\\nDiffusers examples are a collection of training scripts that reside in [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples).\\n\\nWe support two types of training examples:\\n\\n- Official training examples\\n- Research training examples\\n\\nResearch training examples are located in [examples/research_projects](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/research_projects) whereas official training examples include all folders under [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples) except the `research_projects` and `community` folders.\\nThe official training examples are maintained by the Diffusers' core maintainers whereas the research training examples are maintained by the community.\\nThis is because of the same reasons put forward in [6. Contribute a community pipeline](#6-contribute-a-community-pipeline) for official pipelines vs. community pipelines: It is not feasible for the core maintainers to maintain all possible training methods for diffusion models.\\nIf the Diffusers core maintainers and the community consider a certain training paradigm to be too experimental or not popular enough, the corresponding training code should be put in the `research_projects` folder and maintained by the author.\\n\\nBoth official training and research examples consist of a directory that contains one or more training scripts, a requirements.txt file, and a README.md file. In order for the user to make use of the\\ntraining examples, it is required to clone the repository:\\n\\n```bash\\ngit clone https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers\\n```\\n\\nas well as to install all additional dependencies required for training:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install -r /examples/&lt;your-example-folder&gt;/requirements.txt\\n```\\n\\nTherefore when adding an example, the `requirements.txt` file shall define all pip dependencies required for your training example so that once all those are installed, the user can run the example's training script. See, for example, the [DreamBooth `requirements.txt` file](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/dreambooth/requirements.txt).\\n\\nTraining examples of the Diffusers library should adhere to the following philosophy:\\n- All the code necessary to run the examples should be found in a single Python file.\\n- One should be able to run the example from the command line with `python &lt;your-example&gt;.py --args`.\\n- Examples should be kept simple and serve as **an example** on how to use Diffusers for training. The purpose of example scripts is **not** to create state-of-the-art diffusion models, but rather to reproduce known training schemes without adding too much custom logic. As a byproduct of this point, our examples also strive to serve as good educational materials.\\n\\nTo contribute an example, it is highly recommended to look at already existing examples such as [dreambooth](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/dreambooth/train_dreambooth.py) to get an idea of how they should look like.\\nWe strongly advise contributors to make use of the [Accelerate library](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) as it's tightly integrated\\nwith Diffusers.\\nOnce an example script works, please make sure to add a comprehensive `README.md` that states how to use the example exactly. This README should include:\\n- An example command on how to run the example script as shown [here e.g.](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/dreambooth#running-locally-with-pytorch).\\n- A link to some training results (logs, models, ...) that show what the user can expect as shown [here e.g.](https://api.wandb.ai/report/patrickvonplaten/xm6cd5q5).\\n- If you are adding a non-official/research training example, **please don't forget** to add a sentence that you are maintaining this training example which includes your git handle as shown [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/research_projects/intel_opts#diffusers-examples-with-intel-optimizations).\\n\\nIf you are contributing to the official training examples, please also make sure to add a test to [examples/test_examples.py](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/test_examples.py). This is not necessary for non-official training examples.\\n\\n### 8. Fixing a \"Good second issue\"\\n\\n*Good second issues* are marked by the [Good second issue](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+second+issue%22) label. Good second issues are\\nusually more complicated to solve than [Good first issues](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).\\nThe issue description usually gives less guidance on how to fix the issue and requires\\na decent understanding of the library by the interested contributor.\\nIf you are interested in tackling a good second issue, feel free to open a PR to fix it and link the PR to the issue. If you see that a PR has already been opened for this issue but did not get merged, have a look to understand why it wasn't merged and try to open an improved PR.\\nGood second issues are usually more difficult to get merged compared to good first issues, so don't hesitate to ask for help from the core maintainers. If your PR is almost finished the core maintainers can also jump into your PR and commit to it in order to get it merged.\\n\\n### 9. Adding pipelines, models, schedulers\\n\\nPipelines, models, and schedulers are the most important pieces of the Diffusers library.\\nThey provide easy access to state-of-the-art diffusion technologies and thus allow the community to\\nbuild powerful generative AI applications.\\n\\nBy adding a new model, pipeline, or scheduler you might enable a new powerful use case for any of the user interfaces relying on Diffusers which can be of immense value for the whole generative AI ecosystem.\\n\\nDiffusers has a couple of open feature requests for all three components - feel free to gloss over them\\nif you don't know yet what specific component you would like to add:\\n- [Model or pipeline](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22New+pipeline%2Fmodel%22)\\n- [Scheduler](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22New+scheduler%22)\\n\\nBefore adding any of the three components, it is strongly recommended that you give the [Philosophy guide](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/PHILOSOPHY.md) a read to better understand the design of any of the three components. Please be aware that\\nwe cannot merge model, scheduler, or pipeline additions that strongly diverge from our design philosophy\\nas it will lead to API inconsistencies. If you fundamentally disagree with a design choice, please\\nopen a [Feedback issue](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=&amp;template=feedback.md&amp;title=) instead so that it can be discussed whether a certain design\\npattern/design choice shall be changed everywhere in the library and whether we shall update our design philosophy. Consistency across the library is very important for us.\\n\\nPlease make sure to add links to the original codebase/paper to the PR and ideally also ping the\\noriginal author directly on the PR so that they can follow the progress and potentially help with questions.\\n\\nIf you are unsure or stuck in the PR, don't hesitate to leave a message to ask for a first review or help.\\n\\n## How to write a good issue\\n\\n**The better your issue is written, the higher the chances that it will be quickly resolved.**\\n\\n1. Make sure that you've used the correct template for your issue. You can pick between *Bug Report*, *Feature Request*, *Feedback about API Design*, *New model/pipeline/scheduler addition*, *Forum*, or a blank issue. Make sure to pick the correct one when opening [a new issue](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new/choose).\\n2. **Be precise**: Give your issue a fitting title. Try to formulate your issue description as simple as possible. The more precise you are when submitting an issue, the less time it takes to understand the issue and potentially solve it. Make sure to open an issue for one issue only and not for multiple issues. If you found multiple issues, simply open multiple issues. If your issue is a bug, try to be as precise as possible about what bug it is - you should not just write \"Error in diffusers\".\\n3. **Reproducibility**: No reproducible code snippet == no solution. If you encounter a bug, maintainers **have to be able to reproduce** it. Make sure that you include a code snippet that can be copy-pasted into a Python interpreter to reproduce the issue. Make sure that your code snippet works, *i.e.* that there are no missing imports or missing links to images, ... Your issue should contain an error message **and** a code snippet that can be copy-pasted without any changes to reproduce the exact same error message. If your issue is using local model weights or local data that cannot be accessed by the reader, the issue cannot be solved. If you cannot share your data or model, try to make a dummy model or dummy data.\\n4. **Minimalistic**: Try to help the reader as much as you can to understand the issue as quickly as possible by staying as concise as possible. Remove all code / all information that is irrelevant to the issue. If you have found a bug, try to create the easiest code example you can to demonstrate your issue, do not just dump your whole workflow into the issue as soon as you have found a bug. E.g., if you train a model and get an error at some point during the training, you should first try to understand what part of the training code is responsible for the error and try to reproduce it with a couple of lines. Try to use dummy data instead of full datasets.\\n5. Add links. If you are referring to a certain naming, method, or model make sure to provide a link so that the reader can better understand what you mean. If you are referring to a specific PR or issue, make sure to link it to your issue. Do not assume that the reader knows what you are talking about. The more links you add to your issue the better.\\n6. Formatting. Make sure to nicely format your issue by formatting code into Python code syntax, and error messages into normal code syntax. See the [official GitHub formatting docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for more information.\\n7. Think of your issue not as a ticket to be solved, but rather as a beautiful entry to a well-written encyclopedia. Every added issue is a contribution to publicly available knowledge. By adding a nicely written issue you not only make it easier for maintainers to solve your issue, but you are helping the whole community to better understand a certain aspect of the library.\\n\\n## How to write a good PR\\n\\n1. Be a chameleon. Understand existing design patterns and syntax and make sure your code additions flow seamlessly into the existing code base. Pull requests that significantly diverge from existing design patterns or user interfaces will not be merged.\\n2. Be laser focused. A pull request should solve one problem and one problem only. Make sure to not fall into the trap of \"also fixing another problem while we're adding it\". It is much more difficult to review pull requests that solve multiple, unrelated problems at once.\\n3. If helpful, try to add a code snippet that displays an example of how your addition can be used.\\n4. The title of your pull request should be a summary of its contribution.\\n5. If your pull request addresses an issue, please mention the issue number in\\nthe pull request description to make sure they are linked (and people\\nconsulting the issue know you are working on it);\\n6. To indicate a work in progress please prefix the title with `[WIP]`. These\\nare useful to avoid duplicated work, and to differentiate it from PRs ready\\nto be merged;\\n7. Try to formulate and format your text as explained in [How to write a good issue](#how-to-write-a-good-issue).\\n8. Make sure existing tests pass;\\n9. Add high-coverage tests. No quality testing = no merge.\\n- If you are adding new `@slow` tests, make sure they pass using\\n`RUN_SLOW=1 python -m pytest tests/test_my_new_model.py`.\\nCircleCI does not run the slow tests, but GitHub Actions does every night!\\n10. All public methods must have informative docstrings that work nicely with markdown. See [`pipeline_latent_diffusion.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/pipelines/latent_diffusion/pipeline_latent_diffusion.py) for an example.\\n11. Due to the rapidly growing repository, it is important to make sure that no files that would significantly weigh down the repository are added. This includes images, videos, and other non-text files. We prefer to leverage a hf.co hosted `dataset` like\\n[`hf-internal-testing`](https://huggingface.co/hf-internal-testing) or [huggingface/documentation-images](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images) to place these files.\\nIf an external contribution, feel free to add the images to your PR and ask a Hugging Face member to migrate your images\\nto this dataset.\\n\\n## How to open a PR\\n\\nBefore writing code, we strongly advise you to search through the existing PRs or\\nissues to make sure that nobody is already working on the same thing. If you are\\nunsure, it is always a good idea to open an issue to get some feedback.\\n\\nYou will need basic `git` proficiency to be able to contribute to\\n🧨 Diffusers. `git` is not the easiest tool to use but it has the greatest\\nmanual. Type `git --help` in a shell and enjoy. If you prefer books, [Pro\\nGit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a very good reference.\\n\\nFollow these steps to start contributing ([supported Python versions](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/setup.py#L265)):\\n\\n1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) by\\nclicking on the 'Fork' button on the repository's page. This creates a copy of the code\\nunder your GitHub user account.\\n\\n2. Clone your fork to your local disk, and add the base repository as a remote:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ git clone git@github.com:&lt;your GitHub handle&gt;/diffusers.git\\n $ cd diffusers\\n $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers.git\\n ```\\n\\n3. Create a new branch to hold your development changes:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ git checkout -b a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes\\n ```\\n\\n**Do not** work on the `main` branch.\\n\\n4. Set up a development environment by running the following command in a virtual environment:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ pip install -e \".[dev]\"\\n ```\\n\\nIf you have already cloned the repo, you might need to `git pull` to get the most recent changes in the\\nlibrary.\\n\\n5. Develop the features on your branch.\\n\\nAs you work on the features, you should make sure that the test suite\\npasses. You should run the tests impacted by your changes like this:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ pytest tests/&lt;TEST_TO_RUN&gt;.py\\n ```\\n\\nBefore you run the tests, please make sure you install the dependencies required for testing. You can do so\\nwith this command:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ pip install -e \".[test]\"\\n ```\\n\\nYou can also run the full test suite with the following command, but it takes\\na beefy machine to produce a result in a decent amount of time now that\\nDiffusers has grown a lot. Here is the command for it:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ make test\\n ```\\n\\n🧨 Diffusers relies on `ruff` and `isort` to format its source code\\nconsistently. After you make changes, apply automatic style corrections and code verifications\\nthat can't be automated in one go with:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ make style\\n ```\\n\\n🧨 Diffusers also uses `ruff` and a few custom scripts to check for coding mistakes. Quality\\ncontrol runs in CI, however, you can also run the same checks with:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ make quality\\n ```\\n\\nOnce you're happy with your changes, add changed files using `git add` and\\nmake a commit with `git commit` to record your changes locally:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ git add modified_file.py\\n $ git commit -m \"A descriptive message about your changes.\"\\n ```\\n\\nIt is a good idea to sync your copy of the code with the original\\nrepository regularly. This way you can quickly account for changes:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ git pull upstream main\\n ```\\n\\nPush the changes to your account using:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ git push -u origin a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes\\n ```\\n\\n6. Once you are satisfied, go to the\\nwebpage of your fork on GitHub. Click on 'Pull request' to send your changes\\nto the project maintainers for review.\\n\\n7. It's ok if maintainers ask you for changes. It happens to core contributors\\ntoo! So everyone can see the changes in the Pull request, work in your local\\nbranch and push the changes to your fork. They will automatically appear in\\nthe pull request.\\n\\n### Tests\\n\\nAn extensive test suite is included to test the library behavior and several examples. Library tests can be found in\\nthe [tests folder](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/tests).\\n\\nWe like `pytest` and `pytest-xdist` because it's faster. From the root of the\\nrepository, here's how to run tests with `pytest` for the library:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ python -m pytest -n auto --dist=loadfile -s -v ./tests/\\n```\\n\\nIn fact, that's how `make test` is implemented!\\n\\nYou can specify a smaller set of tests in order to test only the feature\\nyou're working on.\\n\\nBy default, slow tests are skipped. Set the `RUN_SLOW` environment variable to\\n`yes` to run them. This will download many gigabytes of models — make sure you\\nhave enough disk space and a good Internet connection, or a lot of patience!\\n\\n```bash\\n$ RUN_SLOW=yes python -m pytest -n auto --dist=loadfile -s -v ./tests/\\n```\\n\\n`unittest` is fully supported, here's how to run tests with it:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ python -m unittest discover -s tests -t . -v\\n$ python -m unittest discover -s examples -t examples -v\\n```\\n\\n### Syncing forked main with upstream (HuggingFace) main\\n\\nTo avoid pinging the upstream repository which adds reference notes to each upstream PR and sends unnecessary notifications to the developers involved in these PRs,\\nwhen syncing the main branch of a forked repository, please, follow these steps:\\n1. When possible, avoid syncing with the upstream using a branch and PR on the forked repository. Instead, merge directly into the forked main.\\n2. If a PR is absolutely necessary, use the following steps after checking out your branch:\\n```bash\\n$ git checkout -b your-branch-for-syncing\\n$ git pull --squash --no-commit upstream main\\n$ git commit -m '&lt;your message without GitHub references&gt;'\\n$ git push --set-upstream origin your-branch-for-syncing\\n```\\n\\n### Style guide\\n\\nFor documentation strings, 🧨 Diffusers follows the [Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).\\n</td>\n","      <td>What is the name of the open-source community that is encouraged to contribute to Diffusers?\\n</td>\n","      <td>The name of the open-source community that is encouraged to contribute to Diffusers is \"Diffusers\".</td>\n","      <td>huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Key Features\\n\\nLet's go through some of the key features of Gradio. This guide is intended to be a high-level overview of various things that you should be aware of as you build your demo. Where appropriate, we link to more detailed guides on specific topics.\\n\\n1. [Components](#components)\\n2. [Queuing](#queuing)\\n3. [Streaming outputs](#streaming-outputs)\\n4. [Streaming inputs](#streaming-inputs)\\n5. [Alert modals](#alert-modals)\\n6. [Styling](#styling)\\n7. [Progress bars](#progress-bars)\\n8. [Batch functions](#batch-functions)\\n\\n## Components\\n\\nGradio includes more than 30 pre-built components (as well as many user-built _custom components_) that can be used as inputs or outputs in your demo with a single line of code. These components correspond to common data types in machine learning and data science, e.g. the `gr.Image` component is designed to handle input or output images, the `gr.Label` component displays classification labels and probabilities, the `gr.Plot` component displays various kinds of plots, and so on.\\n\\nEach component includes various constructor attributes that control the properties of the component. For example, you can control the number of lines in a `gr.Textbox` using the `lines` argument (which takes a positive integer) in its constructor. Or you can control the way that a user can provide an image in the `gr.Image` component using the `sources` parameter (which takes a list like `[\"webcam\", \"upload\"]`).\\n\\n**Static and Interactive Components**\\n\\nEvery component has a _static_ version that is designed to *display* data, and most components also have an _interactive_ version designed to let users input or modify the data. Typically, you don't need to think about this distinction, because when you build a Gradio demo, Gradio automatically figures out whether the component should be static or interactive based on whether it is being used as an input or output. However, you can set this manually using the `interactive` argument that every component supports.\\n\\n**Preprocessing and Postprocessing**\\n\\nWhen a component is used as an input, Gradio automatically handles the _preprocessing_ needed to convert the data from a type sent by the user's browser (such as an uploaded image) to a form that can be accepted by your function (such as a `numpy` array).\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, when a component is used as an output, Gradio automatically handles the _postprocessing_ needed to convert the data from what is returned by your function (such as a list of image paths) to a form that can be displayed in the user's browser (a gallery of images).\\n\\nConsider an example demo with three input components (`gr.Textbox`, `gr.Number`, and `gr.Image`) and two outputs (`gr.Number` and `gr.Gallery`) that serve as a UI for your image-to-image generation model. Below is a diagram of what our preprocessing will send to the model and what our postprocessing will require from it.\\n\\n![](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/guides/assets/dataflow.svg?raw=true)\\n\\nIn this image, the following preprocessing steps happen to send the data from the browser to your function:\\n\\n* The text in the textbox is converted to a Python `str` (essentially no preprocessing)\\n* The number in the number input in converted to a Python `float` (essentially no preprocessing)\\n* Most importantly, ihe image supplied by the user is converted to a `numpy.array` representation of the RGB values in the image\\n\\nImages are converted to NumPy arrays because they are a common format for machine learning workflows. You can control the _preprocessing_ using the component's parameters when constructing the component. For example, if you instantiate the `Image` component with the following parameters, it will preprocess the image to the `PIL` format instead:\\n\\n```py\\nimg = gr.Image(type=\"pil\")\\n```\\n\\nPostprocessing is even simpler! Gradio automatically recognizes the format of the returned data (e.g. does the user's function return a `numpy` array or a `str` filepath for the `gr.Image` component?) and postprocesses it appropriately into a format that can be displayed by the browser.\\n\\nSo in the image above, the following postprocessing steps happen to send the data returned from a user's function to the browser:\\n\\n* The `float` is displayed as a number and displayed directly to the user\\n* The list of string filepaths (`list[str]`) is interpreted as a list of image filepaths and displayed as a gallery in the browser\\n\\nTake a look at the [Docs](https://gradio.app/docs) to see all the parameters for each Gradio component.\\n\\n## Queuing\\n\\nEvery Gradio app comes with a built-in queuing system that can scale to thousands of concurrent users. You can configure the queue by using `queue()` method which is supported by the `gr.Interface`, `gr.Blocks`, and `gr.ChatInterface` classes. \\n\\nFor example, you can control the number of requests processed at a single time by setting the `default_concurrency_limit` parameter of `queue()`, e.g.\\n\\n```python\\ndemo = gr.Interface(...).queue(default_concurrency_limit=5)\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\n\\nThis limits the number of requests processed for this event listener at a single time to 5. By default, the `default_concurrency_limit` is actually set to `1`, which means that when many users are using your app, only a single user's request will be processed at a time. This is because many machine learning functions consume a significant amount of memory and so it is only suitable to have a single user using the demo at a time. However, you can change this parameter in your demo easily.\\n\\nSee the [docs on queueing](/docs/interface#interface-queue) for more details on configuring the queuing parameters.\\n\\n## Streaming outputs\\n\\nIn some cases, you may want to stream a sequence of outputs rather than show a single output at once. For example, you might have an image generation model and you want to show the image that is generated at each step, leading up to the final image. Or you might have a chatbot which streams its response one token at a time instead of returning it all at once.\\n\\nIn such cases, you can supply a **generator** function into Gradio instead of a regular function. Creating generators in Python is very simple: instead of a single `return` value, a function should `yield` a series of values instead. Usually the `yield` statement is put in some kind of loop. Here's an example of an generator that simply counts up to a given number:\\n\\n```python\\ndef my_generator(x):\\n    for i in range(x):\\n        yield i\\n```\\n\\nYou supply a generator into Gradio the same way as you would a regular function. For example, here's a a (fake) image generation model that generates noise for several steps before outputting an image using the `gr.Interface` class:\\n\\n$code_fake_diffusion\\n$demo_fake_diffusion\\n\\nNote that we've added a `time.sleep(1)` in the iterator to create an artificial pause between steps so that you are able to observe the steps of the iterator (in a real image generation model, this probably wouldn't be necessary).\\n\\n## Streaming inputs\\n\\nSimilarly, Gradio can handle streaming inputs, e.g. a live audio stream that can gets transcribed to text in real time, or an image generation model that reruns every time a user types a letter in a textbox. This is covered in more details in our guide on building [reactive Interfaces](/guides/reactive-interfaces). \\n\\n## Alert modals\\n\\nYou may wish to raise alerts to the user. To do so, raise a `gr.Error(\"custom message\")` to display an error message. You can also issue `gr.Warning(\"message\")` and `gr.Info(\"message\")` by having them as standalone lines in your function, which will immediately display modals while continuing the execution of your function. Queueing needs to be enabled for this to work.\\n\\nNote below how the `gr.Error` has to be raised, while the `gr.Warning` and `gr.Info` are single lines.\\n\\n```python\\ndef start_process(name):\\n    gr.Info(\"Starting process\")\\n    if name is None:\\n        gr.Warning(\"Name is empty\")\\n    ...\\n    if success == False:\\n        raise gr.Error(\"Process failed\")\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n## Styling\\n\\nGradio themes are the easiest way to customize the look and feel of your app. You can choose from a variety of themes, or create your own. To do so, pass the `theme=` kwarg to the `Interface` constructor. For example:\\n\\n```python\\ndemo = gr.Interface(..., theme=gr.themes.Monochrome())\\n```\\n\\nGradio comes with a set of prebuilt themes which you can load from `gr.themes.*`. You can extend these themes or create your own themes from scratch - see the [theming guide](https://gradio.app/guides/theming-guide) for more details.\\n\\nFor additional styling ability, you can pass any CSS (as well as custom JavaScript) to your Gradio application. This is discussed in more detail in our [custom JS and CSS guide](/guides/custom-CSS-and-JS).\\n\\n\\n## Progress bars\\n\\nGradio supports the ability to create custom Progress Bars so that you have customizability and control over the progress update that you show to the user. In order to enable this, simply add an argument to your method that has a default value of a `gr.Progress` instance. Then you can update the progress levels by calling this instance directly with a float between 0 and 1, or using the `tqdm()` method of the `Progress` instance to track progress over an iterable, as shown below.\\n\\n$code_progress_simple\\n$demo_progress_simple\\n\\nIf you use the `tqdm` library, you can even report progress updates automatically from any `tqdm.tqdm` that already exists within your function by setting the default argument as `gr.Progress(track_tqdm=True)`!\\n\\n## Batch functions\\n\\nGradio supports the ability to pass _batch_ functions. Batch functions are just\\nfunctions which take in a list of inputs and return a list of predictions.\\n\\nFor example, here is a batched function that takes in two lists of inputs (a list of\\nwords and a list of ints), and returns a list of trimmed words as output:\\n\\n```py\\nimport time\\n\\ndef trim_words(words, lens):\\n    trimmed_words = []\\n    time.sleep(5)\\n    for w, l in zip(words, lens):\\n        trimmed_words.append(w[:int(l)])\\n    return [trimmed_words]\\n```\\n\\nThe advantage of using batched functions is that if you enable queuing, the Gradio server can automatically _batch_ incoming requests and process them in parallel,\\npotentially speeding up your demo. Here's what the Gradio code looks like (notice the `batch=True` and `max_batch_size=16`)\\n\\nWith the `gr.Interface` class:\\n\\n```python\\ndemo = gr.Interface(\\n    fn=trim_words, \\n    inputs=[\"textbox\", \"number\"], \\n    outputs=[\"output\"],\\n    batch=True, \\n    max_batch_size=16\\n)\\n\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\n\\nWith the `gr.Blocks` class:\\n\\n```py\\nimport gradio as gr\\n\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\n    with gr.Row():\\n        word = gr.Textbox(label=\"word\")\\n        leng = gr.Number(label=\"leng\")\\n        output = gr.Textbox(label=\"Output\")\\n    with gr.Row():\\n        run = gr.Button()\\n\\n    event = run.click(trim_words, [word, leng], output, batch=True, max_batch_size=16)\\n\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\n\\nIn the example above, 16 requests could be processed in parallel (for a total inference time of 5 seconds), instead of each request being processed separately (for a total\\ninference time of 80 seconds). Many Hugging Face `transformers` and `diffusers` models work very naturally with Gradio's batch mode: here's [an example demo using diffusers to\\ngenerate images in batches](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/demo/diffusers_with_batching/run.py)\\n\\n\\n</td>\n","      <td>What does Gradio `Blocks` allow you to do?\\n</td>\n","      <td>Gradio `Blocks` allows you to combine multiple demos into one web app, assign event triggers such as clicked/changed/etc to `Blocks` components, automatically determine which `Blocks` component should be interactive vs. static, and create multi-step demos.</td>\n","      <td>gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/guides/01_getting-started/02_key-features.md</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>!--Copyright 2020 The HuggingFace Team.

In this paper we propose a new model architecture DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with\\ndisentangled attention) that improves the BERT and RoBERTa models using two novel techniques. The first is the\\ndisentangled attention mechanism, where each word is represented using two vectors that encode its content and\\nposition, respectively, and the attention weights among words are computed using disentangled matrices on their\\ncontents and relative positions. Second, an enhanced mask decoder is used to replace the output softmax layer to\\npredict the masked tokens for model pretraining. We show that these two techniques significantly improve the efficiency\\nof model pretraining and performance of downstream tasks. Compared to RoBERTa-Large, a DeBERTa model trained on half of\\nthe training data performs consistently better on a wide range of NLP tasks, achieving improvements on MNLI by +0.9%\\n(90.2% vs. 91.1%), on SQuAD v2.0 by +2.3% (88.4% vs. 90.7%) and RACE by +3.6% (83.2% vs. 86.8%). The DeBERTa code and\\npre-trained models will be made publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/DeBERTa.*\\n\\n\\nThe following information is visible directly on the [original implementation\\nrepository](https://github.com/microsoft/DeBERTa). DeBERTa v2 is the second version of the DeBERTa model. It includes\\nthe 1.5B model used for the SuperGLUE single-model submission and achieving 89.9, versus human baseline 89.8. You can\\nfind more details about this submission in the authors'\\n[blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/microsoft-deberta-surpasses-human-performance-on-the-superglue-benchmark/)\\n\\nNew in v2:\\n\\n- **Vocabulary** In v2 the tokenizer is changed to use a new vocabulary of size 128K built from the training data.\\n  Instead of a GPT2-based tokenizer, the tokenizer is now\\n  [sentencepiece-based](https://github.com/google/sentencepiece) tokenizer.\\n- **nGiE(nGram Induced Input Encoding)** The DeBERTa-v2 model uses an additional convolution layer aside with the first\\n  transformer layer to better learn the local dependency of input tokens.\\n- **Sharing position projection matrix with content projection matrix in attention layer** Based on previous\\n  experiments, this can save parameters without affecting the performance.\\n- **Apply bucket to encode relative positions** The DeBERTa-v2 model uses log bucket to encode relative positions\\n  similar to T5.\\n- **900M model &amp; 1.5B model** Two additional model sizes are available: 900M and 1.5B, which significantly improves the\\n  performance of downstream tasks.\\n\\nThis model was contributed by [DeBERTa](https://huggingface.co/DeBERTa).

The models are now available in [`🤗 transformers`](https://huggingface.co/transformers), an open-source library that offers easy-to-use implementations of state-of-the-art models. Along the way, you'll learn about the difference between the various forms of image segmentation.**\\n\\n## Image segmentation\\n\\nImage segmentation is the task of identifying different \"segments\" in an image, like people or cars. More technically, image segmentation is the task of grouping pixels with different semantics. Refer to the Hugging Face [task page](https://huggingface.co/tasks/image-segmentation) for a brief introduction.\\n\\nImage segmentation can largely be split into 3 subtasks - instance, semantic and panoptic segmentation - with numerous methods and model architectures to perform each subtask.\\n\\n- **instance segmentation** is the task of identifying different \"instances\", like individual people, in an image. Instance segmentation is very similar to object detection, except that we'd like to output a set of binary segmentation masks, rather than bounding boxes, with corresponding class labels. Instances are oftentimes also called \"objects\" or \"things\". Note that individual instances may overlap.\\n- **semantic segmentation** is the task of identifying different \"semantic categories\", like \"person\" or \"sky\" of each pixel in an image. Contrary to instance segmentation, no distinction is made between individual instances of a given semantic category; one just likes to come up with a mask for the \"person\" category, rather than for the individual people for example. Semantic categories which don't have individual instances, like \"sky\" or \"grass\", are oftentimes referred to as \"stuff\", to make the distinction with \"things\" (great names, huh?). Note that no overlap between semantic categories is possible, as each pixel belongs to one category.\\n- **panoptic segmentation**, introduced in 2018 by [Kirillov et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00868), aims to unify instance and semantic segmentation, by making models simply identify a set of \"segments\", each with a corresponding binary mask and class label. Segments can be both \"things\" or \"stuff\". Unlike in instance segmentation, no overlap between different segments is possible.\\n\\nThe figure below illustrates the difference between the 3 subtasks (taken from [this blog post](https://www.v7labs.com/blog/panoptic-segmentation-guide)).\\n\\n&lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;\\n    &lt;img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/127_mask2former/semantic_vs_semantic_vs_panoptic.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=500&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\nOver the last years, researchers have come up with several architectures that were typically very tailored to either instance, semantic or panoptic segmentation. Instance and panoptic segmentation were typically solved by outputting a set of binary masks + corresponding labels per object instance (very similar to object detection, except that one outputs a binary mask instead of a bounding box per instance). This is oftentimes called \"binary mask classification\". Semantic segmentation on the other hand was typically solved by making models output a single \"segmentation map\" with one label per pixel. Hence, semantic segmentation was treated as a \"per-pixel classification\" problem. Popular semantic segmentation models which adopt this paradigm are [SegFormer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/segformer), on which we wrote an extensive [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-segformer), and [UPerNet](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/upernet).\\n\\n## Universal image segmentation\\n\\nLuckily, since around 2020, people started to come up with models that can solve all 3 tasks (instance, semantic and panoptic segmentation) with a unified architecture, using the same paradigm. This started with [DETR](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/detr), which was the first model that solved panoptic segmentation using a \"binary mask classification\" paradigm, by treating \"things\" and \"stuff\" classes in a unified way. The key innovation was to have a Transformer decoder come up with a set of binary masks + classes in a parallel way. This was then improved in the [MaskFormer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/maskformer) paper, which showed that the \"binary mask classification\" paradigm also works really well for semantic segmentation.\\n\\n[Mask2Former](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/mask2former) extends this to instance segmentation by further improving the neural network architecture. Hence, we've evolved from separate architectures to what researchers now refer to as \"universal image segmentation\" architectures, capable of solving any image segmentation task. Interestingly, these universal models all adopt the \"mask classification\" paradigm, discarding the \"per-pixel classification\" paradigm entirely. A figure illustrating Mask2Former's architecture is depicted below (taken from the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01527)).\\n\\n&lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;\\n    &lt;img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/mask2former_architecture.jpg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=500&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\nIn short, an image is first sent through a backbone (which, in the paper could be either [ResNet](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/resnet) or [Swin Transformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/swin)) to get a list of low-resolution feature maps. Next, these feature maps are enhanced using a pixel decoder module to get high-resolution features. Finally, a Transformer decoder takes in a set of queries and transforms them into a set of binary mask and class predictions, conditioned on the pixel decoder's features.\\n\\nNote that Mask2Former still needs to be trained on each task separately to obtain state-of-the-art results. This has been improved by the [OneFormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06220) model, which obtains state-of-the-art performance on all 3 tasks by only training on a panoptic version of the dataset (!), by adding a text encoder to condition the model on either \"instance\", \"semantic\" or \"panoptic\" inputs. This model is also as of today [available in 🤗 transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/oneformer). It's even more accurate than Mask2Former, but comes with greater latency due to the additional text encoder. See the figure below for an overview of OneFormer. It leverages either Swin Transformer or the new [DiNAT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/dinat) model as backbone.\\n\\n&lt;p align=\"center\"&gt;\\n    &lt;img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/oneformer_architecture.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=500&gt;\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n## Inference with Mask2Former and OneFormer in Transformers\\n\\nUsage of Mask2Former and OneFormer is pretty straightforward, and very similar to their predecessor MaskFormer. Let's instantiate a Mask2Former model from the hub trained on the COCO panoptic dataset, along with its processor. Note that the authors released no less than [30 checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/models?other=mask2former) trained on various datasets.\\n\\n```\\nfrom transformers import AutoImageProcessor, Mask2FormerForUniversalSegmentation\\n\\nprocessor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained(\"facebook/mask2former-swin-base-coco-panoptic\")\\nmodel = Mask2FormerForUniversalSegmentation.from_pretrained(\"facebook/mask2former-swin-base-coco-panoptic\")\\n```\\n\\nNext, let's load the familiar cats image from the COCO dataset, on which we'll perform inference.\\n\\n```\\nfrom PIL import Image\\n\\nurl = \"http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg\"\\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\\nimage\\n```\\n\\n&lt;img src=\"assets/78_annotated-diffusion/output_cats.jpeg\" width=\"400\" /&gt;\\n\\nWe prepare the image for the model using the image processor, and forward it through the model.\\n\\n```\\ninputs = processor(image, return_tensors=\"pt\")\\n\\nwith torch.no_grad():\\n    outputs = model(**inputs)\\n```\\n\\nThe model outputs a set of binary masks and corresponding class logits. The raw outputs of Mask2Former can be easily postprocessed using the image processor to get the final instance, semantic or panoptic segmentation predictions:\\n\\n```\\nprediction = processor.post_process_panoptic_segmentation(outputs, target_sizes=[image.size[::-1]])[0]\\nprint(prediction.keys())\\n```\\n&lt;div class=\"output stream stdout\"&gt;\\n\\n    Output:\\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    dict_keys(['segmentation', 'segments_info'])\\n\\n&lt;/div&gt;\\n\\nIn panoptic segmentation, the final `prediction` contains 2 things: a `segmentation` map of shape (height, width) where each value encodes the instance ID of a given pixel, as well as a corresponding `segments_info`. The  `segments_info` contains more information about the individual segments of the map (such as their class / category ID). Note that Mask2Former outputs binary mask proposals of shape (96, 96) for efficiency and the `target_sizes` argument is used to resize the final mask to the original image size.\\n\\nLet's visualize the results:\\n\\n```\\nfrom collections import defaultdict\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nimport matplotlib.patches as mpatches\\nfrom matplotlib import cm\\n\\ndef draw_panoptic_segmentation(segmentation, segments_info):\\n    # get the used color map\\n    viridis = cm.get_cmap('viridis', torch.max(segmentation))\\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots()\\n    ax.imshow(segmentation)\\n    instances_counter = defaultdict(int)\\n    handles = []\\n    # for each segment, draw its legend\\n    for segment in segments_info:\\n        segment_id = segment['id']\\n        segment_label_id = segment['label_id']\\n        segment_label = model.config.id2label[segment_label_id]\\n        label = f\"{segment_label}-{instances_counter[segment_label_id]}\"\\n        instances_counter[segment_label_id] += 1\\n        color = viridis(segment_id)\\n        handles.append(mpatches.Patch(color=color, label=label))\\n        \\n    ax.legend(handles=handles)\\n\\ndraw_panoptic_segmentation(**panoptic_segmentation)\\n```\\n\\n&lt;img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/127_mask2former/cats_panoptic_result.png\" width=\"400\" /&gt;\\n\\nHere, we can see that the model is capable of detecting the individual cats and remotes in the image. Semantic segmentation on the other hand would just create a single mask for the \"cat\" category.\\n\\nTo perform inference with OneFormer, which has an identical API except that it also takes an additional text prompt as input, we refer to the [demo notebook](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/tree/master/OneFormer).\\n\\n## Fine-tuning Mask2Former and OneFormer in Transformers\\n\\nFor fine-tuning Mask2Former/OneFormer on a custom dataset for either instance, semantic and panoptic segmentation, check out our [demo notebooks](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/tree/master/MaskFormer/Fine-tuning). MaskFormer, Mask2Former and OneFormer share a similar API so upgrading from MaskFormer is easy and requires minimal changes.\\n\\nThe demo notebooks make use of `MaskFormerForInstanceSegmentation` to load the model whereas you'll have to switch to using either `Mask2FormerForUniversalSegmentation` or `OneFormerForUniversalSegmentation`. In case of image processing for Mask2Former, you'll also have to switch to using `Mask2FormerImageProcessor`. You can also load the image processor using the `AutoImageProcessor` class which automatically takes care of loading the correct processor corresponding to your model. OneFormer on the other hand requires a `OneFormerProcessor`, which prepares the images, along with a text input, for the model.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThat's it!

Everyone is welcome, and all types of participation \\u2013not just code\\u2013 are valued and appreciated. Answering questions, helping others, reaching out, and improving the documentation are all immensely valuable to the community, so don't be afraid and get involved if you're up for it!\\n\\nEveryone is encouraged to start by saying \\ud83d\\udc4b in our public Discord channel. We discuss the latest trends in diffusion models, ask questions, show off personal projects, help each other with contributions, or just hang out \\u2615. <a href=\\\"https://discord.gg/G7tWnz98XR\\\"><img alt=\\\"Join us on Discord\\\" src=\\\"https://img.shields.io/discord/823813159592001537?color=5865F2&logo=Discord&logoColor=white\\\"></a>\\n\\nWhichever way you choose to contribute, we strive to be part of an open, welcoming, and kind community. Please, read our [code of conduct](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and be mindful to respect it during your interactions. We also recommend you become familiar with the [ethical guidelines](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/ethical_guidelines) that guide our project and ask you to adhere to the same principles of transparency and responsibility.\\n\\nWe enormously value feedback from the community, so please do not be afraid to speak up if you believe you have valuable feedback that can help improve the library - every message, comment, issue, and pull request (PR) is read and considered.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nYou can contribute in many ways ranging from answering questions on issues to adding new diffusion models to\\nthe core library.\\n\\nIn the following, we give an overview of different ways to contribute, ranked by difficulty in ascending order. All of them are valuable to the community.\\n\\n* 1. Asking and answering questions on [the Diffusers discussion forum](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/discussion-related-to-httpsgithubcomhuggingfacediffusers) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/G7tWnz98XR).\\n* 2. Opening new issues on [the GitHub Issues tab](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new/choose).\\n* 3. Answering issues on [the GitHub Issues tab](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues).\\n* 4. Fix a simple issue, marked by the \\\"Good first issue\\\" label, see [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).\\n* 5. Contribute to the [documentation](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/docs/source).\\n* 6. Contribute a [Community Pipeline](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Acommunity-examples).\\n* 7. Contribute to the [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples).\\n* 8. Fix a more difficult issue, marked by the \\\"Good second issue\\\" label, see [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+second+issue%22).\\n* 9. Add a new pipeline, model, or scheduler, see [\\\"New Pipeline/Model\\\"](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22New+pipeline%2Fmodel%22) and [\\\"New scheduler\\\"](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22New+scheduler%22) issues. For this contribution, please have a look at [Design Philosophy](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/PHILOSOPHY.md).\\n\\nAs said before, **all contributions are valuable to the community**.\\nIn the following, we will explain each contribution a bit more in detail.\\n\\nFor all contributions 4-9, you will need to open a PR. It is explained in detail how to do so in [Opening a pull request](#how-to-open-a-pr).\\n\\n### 1. Asking and answering questions on the Diffusers discussion forum or on the Diffusers Discord\\n\\nAny question or comment related to the Diffusers library can be asked on the [discussion forum](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/discussion-related-to-httpsgithubcomhuggingfacediffusers/) or on [Discord](https://discord.gg/G7tWnz98XR). Such questions and comments include (but are not limited to):\\n- Reports of training or inference experiments in an attempt to share knowledge\\n- Presentation of personal projects\\n- Questions to non-official training examples\\n- Project proposals\\n- General feedback\\n- Paper summaries\\n- Asking for help on personal projects that build on top of the Diffusers library\\n- General questions\\n- Ethical questions regarding diffusion models\\n- ...\\n\\nEvery question that is asked on the forum or on Discord actively encourages the community to publicly\\nshare knowledge and might very well help a beginner in the future that has the same question you're\\nhaving. Please do pose any questions you might have.\\nIn the same spirit, you are of immense help to the community by answering such questions because this way you are publicly documenting knowledge for everybody to learn from.\\n\\n**Please** keep in mind that the more effort you put into asking or answering a question, the higher\\nthe quality of the publicly documented knowledge. In the same way, well-posed and well-answered questions create a high-quality knowledge database accessible to everybody, while badly posed questions or answers reduce the overall quality of the public knowledge database.\\nIn short, a high quality question or answer is *precise*, *concise*, *relevant*, *easy-to-understand*, *accessible*, and *well-formated/well-posed*. For more information, please have a look through the [How to write a good issue](#how-to-write-a-good-issue) section.\\n\\n**NOTE about channels**:\\n[*The forum*](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/discussion-related-to-httpsgithubcomhuggingfacediffusers/63) is much better indexed by search engines, such as Google. Posts are ranked by popularity rather than chronologically. Hence, it's easier to look up questions and answers that we posted some time ago.\\nIn addition, questions and answers posted in the forum can easily be linked to.\\nIn contrast, *Discord* has a chat-like format that invites fast back-and-forth communication.\\nWhile it will most likely take less time for you to get an answer to your question on Discord, your\\nquestion won't be visible anymore over time. Also, it's much harder to find information that was posted a while back on Discord. We therefore strongly recommend using the forum for high-quality questions and answers in an attempt to create long-lasting knowledge for the community. If discussions on Discord lead to very interesting answers and conclusions, we recommend posting the results on the forum to make the information more available for future readers.\\n\\n### 2. Opening new issues on the GitHub issues tab\\n\\nThe \\ud83e\\udde8 Diffusers library is robust and reliable thanks to the users who notify us of\\nthe problems they encounter. So thank you for reporting an issue.\\n\\nRemember, GitHub issues are reserved for technical questions directly related to the Diffusers library, bug reports, feature requests, or feedback on the library design.\\n\\nIn a nutshell, this means that everything that is **not** related to the **code of the Diffusers library** (including the documentation) should **not** be asked on GitHub, but rather on either the [forum](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/discussion-related-to-httpsgithubcomhuggingfacediffusers/63) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/G7tWnz98XR).\\n\\n**Please consider the following guidelines when opening a new issue**:\\n- Make sure you have searched whether your issue has already been asked before (use the search bar on GitHub under Issues).\\n- Please never report a new issue on another (related) issue. If another issue is highly related, please\\nopen a new issue nevertheless and link to the related issue.\\n- Make sure your issue is written in English. Please use one of the great, free online translation services, such as [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) to translate from your native language to English if you are not comfortable in English.\\n- Check whether your issue might be solved by updating to the newest Diffusers version. Before posting your issue, please make sure that `python -c \\\"import diffusers; print(diffusers.__version__)\\\"` is higher or matches the latest Diffusers version.\\n- Remember that the more effort you put into opening a new issue, the higher the quality of your answer will be and the better the overall quality of the Diffusers issues.\\n\\nNew issues usually include the following.\\n\\n#### 2.1. Reproducible, minimal bug reports\\n\\nA bug report should always have a reproducible code snippet and be as minimal and concise as possible.\\nThis means in more detail:\\n- Narrow the bug down as much as you can, **do not just dump your whole code file**.\\n- Format your code.\\n- Do not include any external libraries except for Diffusers depending on them.\\n- **Always** provide all necessary information about your environment; for this, you can run: `diffusers-cli env` in your shell and copy-paste the displayed information to the issue.\\n- Explain the issue. If the reader doesn't know what the issue is and why it is an issue, she cannot solve it.\\n- **Always** make sure the reader can reproduce your issue with as little effort as possible. If your code snippet cannot be run because of missing libraries or undefined variables, the reader cannot help you. Make sure your reproducible code snippet is as minimal as possible and can be copy-pasted into a simple Python shell.\\n- If in order to reproduce your issue a model and/or dataset is required, make sure the reader has access to that model or dataset. You can always upload your model or dataset to the [Hub](https://huggingface.co) to make it easily downloadable. Try to keep your model and dataset as small as possible, to make the reproduction of your issue as effortless as possible.\\n\\nFor more information, please have a look through the [How to write a good issue](#how-to-write-a-good-issue) section.\\n\\nYou can open a bug report [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug-report.yml).\\n\\n#### 2.2. Feature requests\\n\\nA world-class feature request addresses the following points:\\n\\n1. Motivation first:\\n* Is it related to a problem/frustration with the library? If so, please explain\\nwhy. Providing a code snippet that demonstrates the problem is best.\\n* Is it related to something you would need for a project? We'd love to hear\\nabout it!\\n* Is it something you worked on and think could benefit the community?\\nAwesome! Tell us what problem it solved for you.\\n2. Write a *full paragraph* describing the feature;\\n3. Provide a **code snippet** that demonstrates its future use;\\n4. In case this is related to a paper, please attach a link;\\n5. Attach any additional information (drawings, screenshots, etc.) you think may help.\\n\\nYou can open a feature request [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=).\\n\\n#### 2.3 Feedback\\n\\nFeedback about the library design and why it is good or not good helps the core maintainers immensely to build a user-friendly library. To understand the philosophy behind the current design philosophy, please have a look [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/conceptual/philosophy). If you feel like a certain design choice does not fit with the current design philosophy, please explain why and how it should be changed. If a certain design choice follows the design philosophy too much, hence restricting use cases, explain why and how it should be changed.\\nIf a certain design choice is very useful for you, please also leave a note as this is great feedback for future design decisions.\\n\\nYou can open an issue about feedback [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feedback.md&title=).\\n\\n#### 2.4 Technical questions\\n\\nTechnical questions are mainly about why certain code of the library was written in a certain way, or what a certain part of the code does. Please make sure to link to the code in question and please provide detail on\\nwhy this part of the code is difficult to understand.\\n\\nYou can open an issue about a technical question [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug-report.yml).\\n\\n#### 2.5 Proposal to add a new model, scheduler, or pipeline\\n\\nIf the diffusion model community released a new model, pipeline, or scheduler that you would like to see in the Diffusers library, please provide the following information:\\n\\n* Short description of the diffusion pipeline, model, or scheduler and link to the paper or public release.\\n* Link to any of its open-source implementation.\\n* Link to the model weights if they are available.\\n\\nIf you are willing to contribute to the model yourself, let us know so we can best guide you. Also, don't forget\\nto tag the original author of the component (model, scheduler, pipeline, etc.) by GitHub handle if you can find it.\\n\\nYou can open a request for a model/pipeline/scheduler [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=New+model%2Fpipeline%2Fscheduler&template=new-model-addition.yml).\\n\\n### 3. Answering issues on the GitHub issues tab\\n\\nAnswering issues on GitHub might require some technical knowledge of Diffusers, but we encourage everybody to give it a try even if you are not 100% certain that your answer is correct.\\nSome tips to give a high-quality answer to an issue:\\n- Be as concise and minimal as possible.\\n- Stay on topic. An answer to the issue should concern the issue and only the issue.\\n- Provide links to code, papers, or other sources that prove or encourage your point.\\n- Answer in code. If a simple code snippet is the answer to the issue or shows how the issue can be solved, please provide a fully reproducible code snippet.\\n\\nAlso, many issues tend to be simply off-topic, duplicates of other issues, or irrelevant. It is of great\\nhelp to the maintainers if you can answer such issues, encouraging the author of the issue to be\\nmore precise, provide the link to a duplicated issue or redirect them to [the forum](https://discuss.huggingface.co/c/discussion-related-to-httpsgithubcomhuggingfacediffusers/63) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/G7tWnz98XR).\\n\\nIf you have verified that the issued bug report is correct and requires a correction in the source code,\\nplease have a look at the next sections.\\n\\nFor all of the following contributions, you will need to open a PR. It is explained in detail how to do so in the [Opening a pull request](#how-to-open-a-pr) section.\\n\\n### 4. Fixing a \\\"Good first issue\\\"\\n\\n*Good first issues* are marked by the [Good first issue](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label. Usually, the issue already\\nexplains how a potential solution should look so that it is easier to fix.\\nIf the issue hasn't been closed and you would like to try to fix this issue, you can just leave a message \\\"I would like to try this issue.\\\". There are usually three scenarios:\\n- a.) The issue description already proposes a fix. In this case and if the solution makes sense to you, you can open a PR or draft PR to fix it.\\n- b.) The issue description does not propose a fix. In this case, you can ask what a proposed fix could look like and someone from the Diffusers team should answer shortly. If you have a good idea of how to fix it, feel free to directly open a PR.\\n- c.) There is already an open PR to fix the issue, but the issue hasn't been closed yet. If the PR has gone stale, you can simply open a new PR and link to the stale PR. PRs often go stale if the original contributor who wanted to fix the issue suddenly cannot find the time anymore to proceed. This often happens in open-source and is very normal. In this case, the community will be very happy if you give it a new try and leverage the knowledge of the existing PR. If there is already a PR and it is active, you can help the author by giving suggestions, reviewing the PR or even asking whether you can contribute to the PR.\\n\\n\\n### 5. Contribute to the documentation\\n\\nA good library **always** has good documentation! The official documentation is often one of the first points of contact for new users of the library, and therefore contributing to the documentation is a **highly\\nvaluable contribution**.\\n\\nContributing to the library can have many forms:\\n\\n- Correcting spelling or grammatical errors.\\n- Correct incorrect formatting of the docstring. If you see that the official documentation is weirdly displayed or a link is broken, we are very happy if you take some time to correct it.\\n- Correct the shape or dimensions of a docstring input or output tensor.\\n- Clarify documentation that is hard to understand or incorrect.\\n- Update outdated code examples.\\n- Translating the documentation to another language.\\n\\nAnything displayed on [the official Diffusers doc page](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index) is part of the official documentation and can be corrected, adjusted in the respective [documentation source](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/docs/source).\\n\\nPlease have a look at [this page](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/docs) on how to verify changes made to the documentation locally.\\n\\n\\n### 6. Contribute a community pipeline\\n\\n[Pipelines](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/overview) are usually the first point of contact between the Diffusers library and the user.\\nPipelines are examples of how to use Diffusers [models](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/models/overview) and [schedulers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/schedulers/overview).\\nWe support two types of pipelines:\\n\\n- Official Pipelines\\n- Community Pipelines\\n\\nBoth official and community pipelines follow the same design and consist of the same type of components.\\n\\nOfficial pipelines are tested and maintained by the core maintainers of Diffusers. Their code\\nresides in [src/diffusers/pipelines](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/src/diffusers/pipelines).\\nIn contrast, community pipelines are contributed and maintained purely by the **community** and are **not** tested.\\nThey reside in [examples/community](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/community) and while they can be accessed via the [PyPI diffusers package](https://pypi.org/project/diffusers/), their code is not part of the PyPI distribution.\\n\\nThe reason for the distinction is that the core maintainers of the Diffusers library cannot maintain and test all\\npossible ways diffusion models can be used for inference, but some of them may be of interest to the community.\\nOfficially released diffusion pipelines,\\nsuch as Stable Diffusion are added to the core src/diffusers/pipelines package which ensures\\nhigh quality of maintenance, no backward-breaking code changes, and testing.\\nMore bleeding edge pipelines should be added as community pipelines. If usage for a community pipeline is high, the pipeline can be moved to the official pipelines upon request from the community. This is one of the ways we strive to be a community-driven library.\\n\\nTo add a community pipeline, one should add a <name-of-the-community>.py file to [examples/community](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/community) and adapt the [examples/community/README.md](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/community/README.md) to include an example of the new pipeline.\\n\\nAn example can be seen [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/pull/2400).\\n\\nCommunity pipeline PRs are only checked at a superficial level and ideally they should be maintained by their original authors.\\n\\nContributing a community pipeline is a great way to understand how Diffusers models and schedulers work. Having contributed a community pipeline is usually the first stepping stone to contributing an official pipeline to the\\ncore package.\\n\\n### 7. Contribute to training examples\\n\\nDiffusers examples are a collection of training scripts that reside in [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples).\\n\\nWe support two types of training examples:\\n\\n- Official training examples\\n- Research training examples\\n\\nResearch training examples are located in [examples/research_projects](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/research_projects) whereas official training examples include all folders under [examples](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples) except the `research_projects` and `community` folders.\\nThe official training examples are maintained by the Diffusers' core maintainers whereas the research training examples are maintained by the community.\\nThis is because of the same reasons put forward in [6. Contribute a community pipeline](#6-contribute-a-community-pipeline) for official pipelines vs. community pipelines: It is not feasible for the core maintainers to maintain all possible training methods for diffusion models.\\nIf the Diffusers core maintainers and the community consider a certain training paradigm to be too experimental or not popular enough, the corresponding training code should be put in the `research_projects` folder and maintained by the author.\\n\\nBoth official training and research examples consist of a directory that contains one or more training scripts, a requirements.txt file, and a README.md file. In order for the user to make use of the\\ntraining examples, it is required to clone the repository:\\n\\n```bash\\ngit clone https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers\\n```\\n\\nas well as to install all additional dependencies required for training:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install -r /examples/<your-example-folder>/requirements.txt\\n```\\n\\nTherefore when adding an example, the `requirements.txt` file shall define all pip dependencies required for your training example so that once all those are installed, the user can run the example's training script. See, for example, the [DreamBooth `requirements.txt` file](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/dreambooth/requirements.txt).\\n\\nTraining examples of the Diffusers library should adhere to the following philosophy:\\n- All the code necessary to run the examples should be found in a single Python file.\\n- One should be able to run the example from the command line with `python <your-example>.py --args`.\\n- Examples should be kept simple and serve as **an example** on how to use Diffusers for training. The purpose of example scripts is **not** to create state-of-the-art diffusion models, but rather to reproduce known training schemes without adding too much custom logic. As a byproduct of this point, our examples also strive to serve as good educational materials.\\n\\nTo contribute an example, it is highly recommended to look at already existing examples such as [dreambooth](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/dreambooth/train_dreambooth.py) to get an idea of how they should look like.\\nWe strongly advise contributors to make use of the [Accelerate library](https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate) as it's tightly integrated\\nwith Diffusers.\\nOnce an example script works, please make sure to add a comprehensive `README.md` that states how to use the example exactly. This README should include:\\n- An example command on how to run the example script as shown [here e.g.](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/dreambooth#running-locally-with-pytorch).\\n- A link to some training results (logs, models, ...) that show what the user can expect as shown [here e.g.](https://api.wandb.ai/report/patrickvonplaten/xm6cd5q5).\\n- If you are adding a non-official/research training example, **please don't forget** to add a sentence that you are maintaining this training example which includes your git handle as shown [here](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/research_projects/intel_opts#diffusers-examples-with-intel-optimizations).\\n\\nIf you are contributing to the official training examples, please also make sure to add a test to [examples/test_examples.py](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/test_examples.py). This is not necessary for non-official training examples.\\n\\n### 8. Fixing a \\\"Good second issue\\\"\\n\\n*Good second issues* are marked by the [Good second issue](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Good+second+issue%22) label. Good second issues are\\nusually more complicated to solve than [Good first issues](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).\\nThe issue description usually gives less guidance on how to fix the issue and requires\\na decent understanding of the library by the interested contributor.\\nIf you are interested in tackling a good second issue, feel free to open a PR to fix it and link the PR to the issue. If you see that a PR has already been opened for this issue but did not get merged, have a look to understand why it wasn't merged and try to open an improved PR.\\nGood second issues are usually more difficult to get merged compared to good first issues, so don't hesitate to ask for help from the core maintainers. If your PR is almost finished the core maintainers can also jump into your PR and commit to it in order to get it merged.\\n\\n### 9. Adding pipelines, models, schedulers\\n\\nPipelines, models, and schedulers are the most important pieces of the Diffusers library.\\nThey provide easy access to state-of-the-art diffusion technologies and thus allow the community to\\nbuild powerful generative AI applications.\\n\\nBy adding a new model, pipeline, or scheduler you might enable a new powerful use case for any of the user interfaces relying on Diffusers which can be of immense value for the whole generative AI ecosystem.\\n\\nDiffusers has a couple of open feature requests for all three components - feel free to gloss over them\\nif you don't know yet what specific component you would like to add:\\n- [Model or pipeline](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22New+pipeline%2Fmodel%22)\\n- [Scheduler](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22New+scheduler%22)\\n\\nBefore adding any of the three components, it is strongly recommended that you give the [Philosophy guide](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/PHILOSOPHY.md) a read to better understand the design of any of the three components. Please be aware that\\nwe cannot merge model, scheduler, or pipeline additions that strongly diverge from our design philosophy\\nas it will lead to API inconsistencies. If you fundamentally disagree with a design choice, please\\nopen a [Feedback issue](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feedback.md&title=) instead so that it can be discussed whether a certain design\\npattern/design choice shall be changed everywhere in the library and whether we shall update our design philosophy. Consistency across the library is very important for us.\\n\\nPlease make sure to add links to the original codebase/paper to the PR and ideally also ping the\\noriginal author directly on the PR so that they can follow the progress and potentially help with questions.\\n\\nIf you are unsure or stuck in the PR, don't hesitate to leave a message to ask for a first review or help.\\n\\n## How to write a good issue\\n\\n**The better your issue is written, the higher the chances that it will be quickly resolved.**\\n\\n1. Make sure that you've used the correct template for your issue. You can pick between *Bug Report*, *Feature Request*, *Feedback about API Design*, *New model/pipeline/scheduler addition*, *Forum*, or a blank issue. Make sure to pick the correct one when opening [a new issue](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/new/choose).\\n2. **Be precise**: Give your issue a fitting title. Try to formulate your issue description as simple as possible. The more precise you are when submitting an issue, the less time it takes to understand the issue and potentially solve it. Make sure to open an issue for one issue only and not for multiple issues. If you found multiple issues, simply open multiple issues. If your issue is a bug, try to be as precise as possible about what bug it is - you should not just write \\\"Error in diffusers\\\".\\n3. **Reproducibility**: No reproducible code snippet == no solution. If you encounter a bug, maintainers **have to be able to reproduce** it. Make sure that you include a code snippet that can be copy-pasted into a Python interpreter to reproduce the issue. Make sure that your code snippet works, *i.e.* that there are no missing imports or missing links to images, ... Your issue should contain an error message **and** a code snippet that can be copy-pasted without any changes to reproduce the exact same error message. If your issue is using local model weights or local data that cannot be accessed by the reader, the issue cannot be solved. If you cannot share your data or model, try to make a dummy model or dummy data.\\n4. **Minimalistic**: Try to help the reader as much as you can to understand the issue as quickly as possible by staying as concise as possible. Remove all code / all information that is irrelevant to the issue. If you have found a bug, try to create the easiest code example you can to demonstrate your issue, do not just dump your whole workflow into the issue as soon as you have found a bug. E.g., if you train a model and get an error at some point during the training, you should first try to understand what part of the training code is responsible for the error and try to reproduce it with a couple of lines. Try to use dummy data instead of full datasets.\\n5. Add links. If you are referring to a certain naming, method, or model make sure to provide a link so that the reader can better understand what you mean. If you are referring to a specific PR or issue, make sure to link it to your issue. Do not assume that the reader knows what you are talking about. The more links you add to your issue the better.\\n6. Formatting. Make sure to nicely format your issue by formatting code into Python code syntax, and error messages into normal code syntax. See the [official GitHub formatting docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for more information.\\n7. Think of your issue not as a ticket to be solved, but rather as a beautiful entry to a well-written encyclopedia. Every added issue is a contribution to publicly available knowledge. By adding a nicely written issue you not only make it easier for maintainers to solve your issue, but you are helping the whole community to better understand a certain aspect of the library.\\n\\n## How to write a good PR\\n\\n1. Be a chameleon. Understand existing design patterns and syntax and make sure your code additions flow seamlessly into the existing code base. Pull requests that significantly diverge from existing design patterns or user interfaces will not be merged.\\n2. Be laser focused. A pull request should solve one problem and one problem only. Make sure to not fall into the trap of \\\"also fixing another problem while we're adding it\\\". It is much more difficult to review pull requests that solve multiple, unrelated problems at once.\\n3. If helpful, try to add a code snippet that displays an example of how your addition can be used.\\n4. The title of your pull request should be a summary of its contribution.\\n5. If your pull request addresses an issue, please mention the issue number in\\nthe pull request description to make sure they are linked (and people\\nconsulting the issue know you are working on it);\\n6. To indicate a work in progress please prefix the title with `[WIP]`. These\\nare useful to avoid duplicated work, and to differentiate it from PRs ready\\nto be merged;\\n7. Try to formulate and format your text as explained in [How to write a good issue](#how-to-write-a-good-issue).\\n8. Make sure existing tests pass;\\n9. Add high-coverage tests. No quality testing = no merge.\\n- If you are adding new `@slow` tests, make sure they pass using\\n`RUN_SLOW=1 python -m pytest tests/test_my_new_model.py`.\\nCircleCI does not run the slow tests, but GitHub Actions does every night!\\n10. All public methods must have informative docstrings that work nicely with markdown. See [`pipeline_latent_diffusion.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/src/diffusers/pipelines/latent_diffusion/pipeline_latent_diffusion.py) for an example.\\n11. Due to the rapidly growing repository, it is important to make sure that no files that would significantly weigh down the repository are added. This includes images, videos, and other non-text files. We prefer to leverage a hf.co hosted `dataset` like\\n[`hf-internal-testing`](https://huggingface.co/hf-internal-testing) or [huggingface/documentation-images](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images) to place these files.\\nIf an external contribution, feel free to add the images to your PR and ask a Hugging Face member to migrate your images\\nto this dataset.\\n\\n## How to open a PR\\n\\nBefore writing code, we strongly advise you to search through the existing PRs or\\nissues to make sure that nobody is already working on the same thing. If you are\\nunsure, it is always a good idea to open an issue to get some feedback.\\n\\nYou will need basic `git` proficiency to be able to contribute to\\n\\ud83e\\udde8 Diffusers. `git` is not the easiest tool to use but it has the greatest\\nmanual. Type `git --help` in a shell and enjoy. If you prefer books, [Pro\\nGit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is a very good reference.\\n\\nFollow these steps to start contributing ([supported Python versions](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/setup.py#L265)):\\n\\n1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) by\\nclicking on the 'Fork' button on the repository's page. This creates a copy of the code\\nunder your GitHub user account.\\n\\n2. Clone your fork to your local disk, and add the base repository as a remote:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ git clone git@github.com:<your GitHub handle>/diffusers.git\\n $ cd diffusers\\n $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers.git\\n ```\\n\\n3. Create a new branch to hold your development changes:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ git checkout -b a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes\\n ```\\n\\n**Do not** work on the `main` branch.\\n\\n4. Set up a development environment by running the following command in a virtual environment:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ pip install -e \\\".[dev]\\\"\\n ```\\n\\nIf you have already cloned the repo, you might need to `git pull` to get the most recent changes in the\\nlibrary.\\n\\n5. Develop the features on your branch.\\n\\nAs you work on the features, you should make sure that the test suite\\npasses. You should run the tests impacted by your changes like this:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ pytest tests/<TEST_TO_RUN>.py\\n ```\\n\\nBefore you run the tests, please make sure you install the dependencies required for testing. You can do so\\nwith this command:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ pip install -e \\\".[test]\\\"\\n ```\\n\\nYou can also run the full test suite with the following command, but it takes\\na beefy machine to produce a result in a decent amount of time now that\\nDiffusers has grown a lot. Here is the command for it:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ make test\\n ```\\n\\n\\ud83e\\udde8 Diffusers relies on `ruff` and `isort` to format its source code\\nconsistently. After you make changes, apply automatic style corrections and code verifications\\nthat can't be automated in one go with:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ make style\\n ```\\n\\n\\ud83e\\udde8 Diffusers also uses `ruff` and a few custom scripts to check for coding mistakes. Quality\\ncontrol runs in CI, however, you can also run the same checks with:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ make quality\\n ```\\n\\nOnce you're happy with your changes, add changed files using `git add` and\\nmake a commit with `git commit` to record your changes locally:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ git add modified_file.py\\n $ git commit -m \\\"A descriptive message about your changes.\\\"\\n ```\\n\\nIt is a good idea to sync your copy of the code with the original\\nrepository regularly. This way you can quickly account for changes:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ git pull upstream main\\n ```\\n\\nPush the changes to your account using:\\n\\n ```bash\\n $ git push -u origin a-descriptive-name-for-my-changes\\n ```\\n\\n6. Once you are satisfied, go to the\\nwebpage of your fork on GitHub. Click on 'Pull request' to send your changes\\nto the project maintainers for review.\\n\\n7. It's ok if maintainers ask you for changes. It happens to core contributors\\ntoo! So everyone can see the changes in the Pull request, work in your local\\nbranch and push the changes to your fork. They will automatically appear in\\nthe pull request.\\n\\n### Tests\\n\\nAn extensive test suite is included to test the library behavior and several examples. Library tests can be found in\\nthe [tests folder](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/tests).\\n\\nWe like `pytest` and `pytest-xdist` because it's faster. From the root of the\\nrepository, here's how to run tests with `pytest` for the library:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ python -m pytest -n auto --dist=loadfile -s -v ./tests/\\n```\\n\\nIn fact, that's how `make test` is implemented!\\n\\nYou can specify a smaller set of tests in order to test only the feature\\nyou're working on.\\n\\nBy default, slow tests are skipped. Set the `RUN_SLOW` environment variable to\\n`yes` to run them. This will download many gigabytes of models \\u2014 make sure you\\nhave enough disk space and a good Internet connection, or a lot of patience!\\n\\n```bash\\n$ RUN_SLOW=yes python -m pytest -n auto --dist=loadfile -s -v ./tests/\\n```\\n\\n`unittest` is fully supported, here's how to run tests with it:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ python -m unittest discover -s tests -t . -v\\n$ python -m unittest discover -s examples -t examples -v\\n```\\n\\n### Syncing forked main with upstream (HuggingFace) main\\n\\nTo avoid pinging the upstream repository which adds reference notes to each upstream PR and sends unnecessary notifications to the developers involved in these PRs,\\nwhen syncing the main branch of a forked repository, please, follow these steps:\\n1. When possible, avoid syncing with the upstream using a branch and PR on the forked repository. Instead, merge directly into the forked main.\\n2. If a PR is absolutely necessary, use the following steps after checking out your branch:\\n```bash\\n$ git checkout -b your-branch-for-syncing\\n$ git pull --squash --no-commit upstream main\\n$ git commit -m '<your message without GitHub references>'\\n$ git push --set-upstream origin your-branch-for-syncing\\n```\\n\\n### Style guide\\n\\nFor documentation strings, \\ud83e\\udde8 Diffusers follows the [Google style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).\\n\",\n          \"--\\ntitle: Universal Image Segmentation with Mask2Former and OneFormer\\nthumbnail: /blog/assets/127_mask2former/thumbnail.png\\nauthors:\\n- user: nielsr\\n- user: shivi\\n- user: adirik\\n---\\n\\n# Universal Image Segmentation with Mask2Former and OneFormer\\n\\n\\n<script async defer src=\\\"https://unpkg.com/medium-zoom-element@0/dist/medium-zoom-element.min.js\\\"></script>\\n\\n**This guide introduces Mask2Former and OneFormer, 2 state-of-the-art neural networks for image segmentation. The models are now available in [`\\ud83e\\udd17 transformers`](https://huggingface.co/transformers), an open-source library that offers easy-to-use implementations of state-of-the-art models. Along the way, you'll learn about the difference between the various forms of image segmentation.**\\n\\n## Image segmentation\\n\\nImage segmentation is the task of identifying different \\\"segments\\\" in an image, like people or cars. More technically, image segmentation is the task of grouping pixels with different semantics. Refer to the Hugging Face [task page](https://huggingface.co/tasks/image-segmentation) for a brief introduction.\\n\\nImage segmentation can largely be split into 3 subtasks - instance, semantic and panoptic segmentation - with numerous methods and model architectures to perform each subtask.\\n\\n- **instance segmentation** is the task of identifying different \\\"instances\\\", like individual people, in an image. Instance segmentation is very similar to object detection, except that we'd like to output a set of binary segmentation masks, rather than bounding boxes, with corresponding class labels. Instances are oftentimes also called \\\"objects\\\" or \\\"things\\\". Note that individual instances may overlap.\\n- **semantic segmentation** is the task of identifying different \\\"semantic categories\\\", like \\\"person\\\" or \\\"sky\\\" of each pixel in an image. Contrary to instance segmentation, no distinction is made between individual instances of a given semantic category; one just likes to come up with a mask for the \\\"person\\\" category, rather than for the individual people for example. Semantic categories which don't have individual instances, like \\\"sky\\\" or \\\"grass\\\", are oftentimes referred to as \\\"stuff\\\", to make the distinction with \\\"things\\\" (great names, huh?). Note that no overlap between semantic categories is possible, as each pixel belongs to one category.\\n- **panoptic segmentation**, introduced in 2018 by [Kirillov et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00868), aims to unify instance and semantic segmentation, by making models simply identify a set of \\\"segments\\\", each with a corresponding binary mask and class label. Segments can be both \\\"things\\\" or \\\"stuff\\\". Unlike in instance segmentation, no overlap between different segments is possible.\\n\\nThe figure below illustrates the difference between the 3 subtasks (taken from [this blog post](https://www.v7labs.com/blog/panoptic-segmentation-guide)).\\n\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">\\n    <img src=\\\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/127_mask2former/semantic_vs_semantic_vs_panoptic.png\\\" alt=\\\"drawing\\\" width=500>\\n</p>\\n\\nOver the last years, researchers have come up with several architectures that were typically very tailored to either instance, semantic or panoptic segmentation. Instance and panoptic segmentation were typically solved by outputting a set of binary masks + corresponding labels per object instance (very similar to object detection, except that one outputs a binary mask instead of a bounding box per instance). This is oftentimes called \\\"binary mask classification\\\". Semantic segmentation on the other hand was typically solved by making models output a single \\\"segmentation map\\\" with one label per pixel. Hence, semantic segmentation was treated as a \\\"per-pixel classification\\\" problem. Popular semantic segmentation models which adopt this paradigm are [SegFormer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/segformer), on which we wrote an extensive [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-segformer), and [UPerNet](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/upernet).\\n\\n## Universal image segmentation\\n\\nLuckily, since around 2020, people started to come up with models that can solve all 3 tasks (instance, semantic and panoptic segmentation) with a unified architecture, using the same paradigm. This started with [DETR](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/detr), which was the first model that solved panoptic segmentation using a \\\"binary mask classification\\\" paradigm, by treating \\\"things\\\" and \\\"stuff\\\" classes in a unified way. The key innovation was to have a Transformer decoder come up with a set of binary masks + classes in a parallel way. This was then improved in the [MaskFormer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/maskformer) paper, which showed that the \\\"binary mask classification\\\" paradigm also works really well for semantic segmentation.\\n\\n[Mask2Former](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/mask2former) extends this to instance segmentation by further improving the neural network architecture. Hence, we've evolved from separate architectures to what researchers now refer to as \\\"universal image segmentation\\\" architectures, capable of solving any image segmentation task. Interestingly, these universal models all adopt the \\\"mask classification\\\" paradigm, discarding the \\\"per-pixel classification\\\" paradigm entirely. A figure illustrating Mask2Former's architecture is depicted below (taken from the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01527)).\\n\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">\\n    <img src=\\\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/mask2former_architecture.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"drawing\\\" width=500>\\n</p>\\n\\nIn short, an image is first sent through a backbone (which, in the paper could be either [ResNet](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/resnet) or [Swin Transformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/swin)) to get a list of low-resolution feature maps. Next, these feature maps are enhanced using a pixel decoder module to get high-resolution features. Finally, a Transformer decoder takes in a set of queries and transforms them into a set of binary mask and class predictions, conditioned on the pixel decoder's features.\\n\\nNote that Mask2Former still needs to be trained on each task separately to obtain state-of-the-art results. This has been improved by the [OneFormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06220) model, which obtains state-of-the-art performance on all 3 tasks by only training on a panoptic version of the dataset (!), by adding a text encoder to condition the model on either \\\"instance\\\", \\\"semantic\\\" or \\\"panoptic\\\" inputs. This model is also as of today [available in \\ud83e\\udd17 transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/oneformer). It's even more accurate than Mask2Former, but comes with greater latency due to the additional text encoder. See the figure below for an overview of OneFormer. It leverages either Swin Transformer or the new [DiNAT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/dinat) model as backbone.\\n\\n<p align=\\\"center\\\">\\n    <img src=\\\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/transformers/model_doc/oneformer_architecture.png\\\" alt=\\\"drawing\\\" width=500>\\n</p>\\n\\n## Inference with Mask2Former and OneFormer in Transformers\\n\\nUsage of Mask2Former and OneFormer is pretty straightforward, and very similar to their predecessor MaskFormer. Let's instantiate a Mask2Former model from the hub trained on the COCO panoptic dataset, along with its processor. Note that the authors released no less than [30 checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/models?other=mask2former) trained on various datasets.\\n\\n```\\nfrom transformers import AutoImageProcessor, Mask2FormerForUniversalSegmentation\\n\\nprocessor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained(\\\"facebook/mask2former-swin-base-coco-panoptic\\\")\\nmodel = Mask2FormerForUniversalSegmentation.from_pretrained(\\\"facebook/mask2former-swin-base-coco-panoptic\\\")\\n```\\n\\nNext, let's load the familiar cats image from the COCO dataset, on which we'll perform inference.\\n\\n```\\nfrom PIL import Image\\n\\nurl = \\\"http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg\\\"\\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\\nimage\\n```\\n\\n<img src=\\\"assets/78_annotated-diffusion/output_cats.jpeg\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" />\\n\\nWe prepare the image for the model using the image processor, and forward it through the model.\\n\\n```\\ninputs = processor(image, return_tensors=\\\"pt\\\")\\n\\nwith torch.no_grad():\\n    outputs = model(**inputs)\\n```\\n\\nThe model outputs a set of binary masks and corresponding class logits. The raw outputs of Mask2Former can be easily postprocessed using the image processor to get the final instance, semantic or panoptic segmentation predictions:\\n\\n```\\nprediction = processor.post_process_panoptic_segmentation(outputs, target_sizes=[image.size[::-1]])[0]\\nprint(prediction.keys())\\n```\\n<div class=\\\"output stream stdout\\\">\\n\\n    Output:\\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n    dict_keys(['segmentation', 'segments_info'])\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nIn panoptic segmentation, the final `prediction` contains 2 things: a `segmentation` map of shape (height, width) where each value encodes the instance ID of a given pixel, as well as a corresponding `segments_info`. The  `segments_info` contains more information about the individual segments of the map (such as their class / category ID). Note that Mask2Former outputs binary mask proposals of shape (96, 96) for efficiency and the `target_sizes` argument is used to resize the final mask to the original image size.\\n\\nLet's visualize the results:\\n\\n```\\nfrom collections import defaultdict\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nimport matplotlib.patches as mpatches\\nfrom matplotlib import cm\\n\\ndef draw_panoptic_segmentation(segmentation, segments_info):\\n    # get the used color map\\n    viridis = cm.get_cmap('viridis', torch.max(segmentation))\\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots()\\n    ax.imshow(segmentation)\\n    instances_counter = defaultdict(int)\\n    handles = []\\n    # for each segment, draw its legend\\n    for segment in segments_info:\\n        segment_id = segment['id']\\n        segment_label_id = segment['label_id']\\n        segment_label = model.config.id2label[segment_label_id]\\n        label = f\\\"{segment_label}-{instances_counter[segment_label_id]}\\\"\\n        instances_counter[segment_label_id] += 1\\n        color = viridis(segment_id)\\n        handles.append(mpatches.Patch(color=color, label=label))\\n        \\n    ax.legend(handles=handles)\\n\\ndraw_panoptic_segmentation(**panoptic_segmentation)\\n```\\n\\n<img src=\\\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/blog/127_mask2former/cats_panoptic_result.png\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" />\\n\\nHere, we can see that the model is capable of detecting the individual cats and remotes in the image. Semantic segmentation on the other hand would just create a single mask for the \\\"cat\\\" category.\\n\\nTo perform inference with OneFormer, which has an identical API except that it also takes an additional text prompt as input, we refer to the [demo notebook](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/tree/master/OneFormer).\\n\\n## Fine-tuning Mask2Former and OneFormer in Transformers\\n\\nFor fine-tuning Mask2Former/OneFormer on a custom dataset for either instance, semantic and panoptic segmentation, check out our [demo notebooks](https://github.com/NielsRogge/Transformers-Tutorials/tree/master/MaskFormer/Fine-tuning). MaskFormer, Mask2Former and OneFormer share a similar API so upgrading from MaskFormer is easy and requires minimal changes.\\n\\nThe demo notebooks make use of `MaskFormerForInstanceSegmentation` to load the model whereas you'll have to switch to using either `Mask2FormerForUniversalSegmentation` or `OneFormerForUniversalSegmentation`. In case of image processing for Mask2Former, you'll also have to switch to using `Mask2FormerImageProcessor`. You can also load the image processor using the `AutoImageProcessor` class which automatically takes care of loading the correct processor corresponding to your model. OneFormer on the other hand requires a `OneFormerProcessor`, which prepares the images, along with a text input, for the model.\\n\\n# Conclusion\\n\\nThat's it! You now know about the difference between instance, semantic and panoptic segmentation, as well as how to use \\\"universal architectures\\\" such as Mask2Former and OneFormer using the [\\ud83e\\udd17 transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers) library.\\n\\nWe hope you enjoyed this post and learned something.

This guide is intended to be a high-level overview of various things that you should be aware of as you build your demo. Where appropriate, we link to more detailed guides on specific topics.\\n\\n1. [Components](#components)\\n2. [Queuing](#queuing)\\n3. [Streaming outputs](#streaming-outputs)\\n4. [Streaming inputs](#streaming-inputs)\\n5. [Alert modals](#alert-modals)\\n6. [Styling](#styling)\\n7. [Progress bars](#progress-bars)\\n8. [Batch functions](#batch-functions)\\n\\n## Components\\n\\nGradio includes more than 30 pre-built components (as well as many user-built _custom components_) that can be used as inputs or outputs in your demo with a single line of code. These components correspond to common data types in machine learning and data science, e.g. the `gr.Image` component is designed to handle input or output images, the `gr.Label` component displays classification labels and probabilities, the `gr.Plot` component displays various kinds of plots, and so on.\\n\\nEach component includes various constructor attributes that control the properties of the component. For example, you can control the number of lines in a `gr.Textbox` using the `lines` argument (which takes a positive integer) in its constructor. Or you can control the way that a user can provide an image in the `gr.Image` component using the `sources` parameter (which takes a list like `[\\\"webcam\\\", \\\"upload\\\"]`).\\n\\n**Static and Interactive Components**\\n\\nEvery component has a _static_ version that is designed to *display* data, and most components also have an _interactive_ version designed to let users input or modify the data. Typically, you don't need to think about this distinction, because when you build a Gradio demo, Gradio automatically figures out whether the component should be static or interactive based on whether it is being used as an input or output. However, you can set this manually using the `interactive` argument that every component supports.\\n\\n**Preprocessing and Postprocessing**\\n\\nWhen a component is used as an input, Gradio automatically handles the _preprocessing_ needed to convert the data from a type sent by the user's browser (such as an uploaded image) to a form that can be accepted by your function (such as a `numpy` array).\\n\\n\\nSimilarly, when a component is used as an output, Gradio automatically handles the _postprocessing_ needed to convert the data from what is returned by your function (such as a list of image paths) to a form that can be displayed in the user's browser (a gallery of images).\\n\\nConsider an example demo with three input components (`gr.Textbox`, `gr.Number`, and `gr.Image`) and two outputs (`gr.Number` and `gr.Gallery`) that serve as a UI for your image-to-image generation model. Below is a diagram of what our preprocessing will send to the model and what our postprocessing will require from it.\\n\\n![](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/guides/assets/dataflow.svg?raw=true)\\n\\nIn this image, the following preprocessing steps happen to send the data from the browser to your function:\\n\\n* The text in the textbox is converted to a Python `str` (essentially no preprocessing)\\n* The number in the number input in converted to a Python `float` (essentially no preprocessing)\\n* Most importantly, ihe image supplied by the user is converted to a `numpy.array` representation of the RGB values in the image\\n\\nImages are converted to NumPy arrays because they are a common format for machine learning workflows. You can control the _preprocessing_ using the component's parameters when constructing the component. For example, if you instantiate the `Image` component with the following parameters, it will preprocess the image to the `PIL` format instead:\\n\\n```py\\nimg = gr.Image(type=\\\"pil\\\")\\n```\\n\\nPostprocessing is even simpler! Gradio automatically recognizes the format of the returned data (e.g. does the user's function return a `numpy` array or a `str` filepath for the `gr.Image` component?) and postprocesses it appropriately into a format that can be displayed by the browser.\\n\\nSo in the image above, the following postprocessing steps happen to send the data returned from a user's function to the browser:\\n\\n* The `float` is displayed as a number and displayed directly to the user\\n* The list of string filepaths (`list[str]`) is interpreted as a list of image filepaths and displayed as a gallery in the browser\\n\\nTake a look at the [Docs](https://gradio.app/docs) to see all the parameters for each Gradio component.\\n\\n## Queuing\\n\\nEvery Gradio app comes with a built-in queuing system that can scale to thousands of concurrent users. You can configure the queue by using `queue()` method which is supported by the `gr.Interface`, `gr.Blocks`, and `gr.ChatInterface` classes. \\n\\nFor example, you can control the number of requests processed at a single time by setting the `default_concurrency_limit` parameter of `queue()`, e.g.\\n\\n```python\\ndemo = gr.Interface(...).queue(default_concurrency_limit=5)\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\n\\nThis limits the number of requests processed for this event listener at a single time to 5. By default, the `default_concurrency_limit` is actually set to `1`, which means that when many users are using your app, only a single user's request will be processed at a time. This is because many machine learning functions consume a significant amount of memory and so it is only suitable to have a single user using the demo at a time. However, you can change this parameter in your demo easily.\\n\\nSee the [docs on queueing](/docs/interface#interface-queue) for more details on configuring the queuing parameters.\\n\\n## Streaming outputs\\n\\nIn some cases, you may want to stream a sequence of outputs rather than show a single output at once. For example, you might have an image generation model and you want to show the image that is generated at each step, leading up to the final image. Or you might have a chatbot which streams its response one token at a time instead of returning it all at once.\\n\\nIn such cases, you can supply a **generator** function into Gradio instead of a regular function. Creating generators in Python is very simple: instead of a single `return` value, a function should `yield` a series of values instead. Usually the `yield` statement is put in some kind of loop. Here's an example of an generator that simply counts up to a given number:\\n\\n```python\\ndef my_generator(x):\\n    for i in range(x):\\n        yield i\\n```\\n\\nYou supply a generator into Gradio the same way as you would a regular function. For example, here's a a (fake) image generation model that generates noise for several steps before outputting an image using the `gr.Interface` class:\\n\\n$code_fake_diffusion\\n$demo_fake_diffusion\\n\\nNote that we've added a `time.sleep(1)` in the iterator to create an artificial pause between steps so that you are able to observe the steps of the iterator (in a real image generation model, this probably wouldn't be necessary).\\n\\n## Streaming inputs\\n\\nSimilarly, Gradio can handle streaming inputs, e.g. a live audio stream that can gets transcribed to text in real time, or an image generation model that reruns every time a user types a letter in a textbox. This is covered in more details in our guide on building [reactive Interfaces](/guides/reactive-interfaces). \\n\\n## Alert modals\\n\\nYou may wish to raise alerts to the user. To do so, raise a `gr.Error(\\\"custom message\\\")` to display an error message. You can also issue `gr.Warning(\\\"message\\\")` and `gr.Info(\\\"message\\\")` by having them as standalone lines in your function, which will immediately display modals while continuing the execution of your function. Queueing needs to be enabled for this to work.\\n\\nNote below how the `gr.Error` has to be raised, while the `gr.Warning` and `gr.Info` are single lines.\\n\\n```python\\ndef start_process(name):\\n    gr.Info(\\\"Starting process\\\")\\n    if name is None:\\n        gr.Warning(\\\"Name is empty\\\")\\n    ...\\n    if success == False:\\n        raise gr.Error(\\\"Process failed\\\")\\n```\\n\\n\\n\\n## Styling\\n\\nGradio themes are the easiest way to customize the look and feel of your app. You can choose from a variety of themes, or create your own. To do so, pass the `theme=` kwarg to the `Interface` constructor. For example:\\n\\n```python\\ndemo = gr.Interface(..., theme=gr.themes.Monochrome())\\n```\\n\\nGradio comes with a set of prebuilt themes which you can load from `gr.themes.*`. You can extend these themes or create your own themes from scratch - see the [theming guide](https://gradio.app/guides/theming-guide) for more details.\\n\\nFor additional styling ability, you can pass any CSS (as well as custom JavaScript) to your Gradio application. This is discussed in more detail in our [custom JS and CSS guide](/guides/custom-CSS-and-JS).\\n\\n\\n## Progress bars\\n\\nGradio supports the ability to create custom Progress Bars so that you have customizability and control over the progress update that you show to the user. In order to enable this, simply add an argument to your method that has a default value of a `gr.Progress` instance. Then you can update the progress levels by calling this instance directly with a float between 0 and 1, or using the `tqdm()` method of the `Progress` instance to track progress over an iterable, as shown below.\\n\\n$code_progress_simple\\n$demo_progress_simple\\n\\nIf you use the `tqdm` library, you can even report progress updates automatically from any `tqdm.tqdm` that already exists within your function by setting the default argument as `gr.Progress(track_tqdm=True)`!\\n\\n## Batch functions\\n\\nGradio supports the ability to pass _batch_ functions. Batch functions are just\\nfunctions which take in a list of inputs and return a list of predictions.\\n\\nFor example, here is a batched function that takes in two lists of inputs (a list of\\nwords and a list of ints), and returns a list of trimmed words as output:\\n\\n```py\\nimport time\\n\\ndef trim_words(words, lens):\\n    trimmed_words = []\\n    time.sleep(5)\\n    for w, l in zip(words, lens):\\n        trimmed_words.append(w[:int(l)])\\n    return [trimmed_words]\\n```\\n\\nThe advantage of using batched functions is that if you enable queuing, the Gradio server can automatically _batch_ incoming requests and process them in parallel,\\npotentially speeding up your demo. Here's what the Gradio code looks like (notice the `batch=True` and `max_batch_size=16`)\\n\\nWith the `gr.Interface` class:\\n\\n```python\\ndemo = gr.Interface(\\n    fn=trim_words, \\n    inputs=[\\\"textbox\\\", \\\"number\\\"], \\n    outputs=[\\\"output\\\"],\\n    batch=True, \\n    max_batch_size=16\\n)\\n\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\n\\nWith the `gr.Blocks` class:\\n\\n```py\\nimport gradio as gr\\n\\nwith gr.Blocks() as demo:\\n    with gr.Row():\\n        word = gr.Textbox(label=\\\"word\\\")\\n        leng = gr.Number(label=\\\"leng\\\")\\n        output = gr.Textbox(label=\\\"Output\\\")\\n    with gr.Row():\\n        run = gr.Button()\\n\\n    event = run.click(trim_words, [word, leng], output, batch=True, max_batch_size=16)\\n\\ndemo.launch()\\n```\\n\\nIn the example above, 16 requests could be processed in parallel (for a total inference time of 5 seconds), instead of each request being processed separately (for a total\\ninference time of 80 seconds). Many Hugging Face `transformers` and `diffusers` models work very naturally with Gradio's batch mode: here's [an example demo using diffusers to\\ngenerate images in batches](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio/blob/main/demo/diffusers_with_batching/run.py)\\n\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n

Mixture of Experts (MoE) defies this and instead selects different parameters for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model -- with outrageous numbers of parameters -- but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs and training instability -- we address these with the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques help wrangle the instabilities and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the first time, with lower precision (bfloat16) formats. We design models based off T5-Base and T5-Large to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the \"Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus\" and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model.\"

Mixture of Experts (MoE) defies this and instead selects different parameters for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model -- with outrageous numbers of parameters -- but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs and training instability -- we address these with the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques help wrangle the instabilities and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the first time, with lower precision (bfloat16) formats. We design models based off T5-Base and T5-Large to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the \"Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus\" and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model.\"</td>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>What is the name of the open-source community that is encouraged to contribute to Diffusers?\\n</td>\n","      <td>The name of the open-source community that is encouraged to contribute to Diffusers is \"Diffusers\".</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>What does Gradio `Blocks` allow you to do?\\n</td>\n","      <td>Gradio `Blocks` allows you to combine multiple demos into one web app, assign event triggers such as clicked/changed/etc to `Blocks` components, automatically determine which `Blocks` component should be interactive vs. static, and create multi-step demos.</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>What is the name of the model architecture proposed in the paper \"DeBERTa: Decoding-enhanced BERT with Disentangled Attention\"?\\n</td>\n","      <td>The name of the model architecture proposed in the paper \"DeBERTa: Decoding-enhanced BERT with Disentangled Attention\" is DeBERTa.</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>What is Mask2Former?\\n</td>\n","      <td>Mask2Former is a unified framework for panoptic, instance and semantic segmentation and features significant performance and efficiency improvements over MaskFormer.</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5</th>\n","      <td>What is the recommended way to install 🤗 Datasets?\\n</td>\n","      <td>The recommended way to install 🤗 Datasets is with pip.</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","      <td>NaN</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>6</th>\n","      <td>What is Wandb?\\n</td>\n","      <td>Wandb (Weights and Biases) is a tool that allows data scientists and machine learning engineers to track their experiments from training to deployment in every phase.
